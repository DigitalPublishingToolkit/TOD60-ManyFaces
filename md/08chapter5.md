> Challenges in Brazil on Accessing Public-Interest Data on State
> Surveillance Tools via Transparency Portals and Requests for
> Information[^08chapter5_1]

*André Ramiro, Pedro Amaral, and Marcos César M. Pereira*

The successive scandals of the Israeli company NSO Group in 2021 and
others^1^ aroused fears in the international community about the use
spyware in a variety of locations. The concern stems from the
capabilities of the spying tool, which allows its user to infect the
target’s device, accessing all stored information, including the ability
to remotely turn on microphones and cameras, all without the infected
person being aware of it. Usually used against activists and opponents
of authoritarian governments, this is not the first time that the public
eye has turned to Pegasus. Since 2018, the Citizen Lab organization has
published a report that denounces the use of the tool in more than 45
countries, breaking down the locations where the tool was operated. That
was the first appearance of the software in national territory, having
reported suspicions that signs of the programme in Brazil also
existed.^2^

In view of this informational power, Brazilian law enforcement has shown
interest in acquiring the NSO Group spy tool. Prior to his election, the
defence of the former and current president of the republic, Luiz Inácio
Lula da Silva, reported that ‘Operation Car Wash’ (Operação Lava Jato)
even negotiated the acquisition of Pegasus.^3^ Former president Jair
Bolsonaro’s son and Rio de Janeiro city councillor, Carlos Bolsonaro,
through an attempt to intervene in the Ministry of Justice, tried to
negotiate the spyware for 25 million reais, newspapers reported.^4^
However, with the revelations that NSO intended to participate in the
public bid, the Israeli company abandoned the negotiations,^5^
emphasizing on the reactions of civil society, such as Conectas,
Transparency International, and Instituto Igarapé, which questioned the
acquisition before the Federal Court of Auditors.^6^ Behind the
curtains, it has been documented that the objective of the acquisition
of Pegasus was to equip the ‘ABIN Paralela’ (Parallel Abin),^7^ an extra
official sector whose objective was to snoop into political opponents,
including inside the government team, a private secret service to meet
the particular agendas of Jair Bolsonaro.^8^

Another tool dealt by Carlos Bolsonaro was the Israeli programme
Sherlock, developed by Candiru, a well-known surveillance firm.
Confirmed by a former representative of the company, the purpose would
be, again, to surveil government officials in order to monitor employees
who could be considered ‘enemies’ of the Bolsonaro administration.^9^
For this, the spy programme would only be used on the federal
government’s internal network, unlike Pegasus, which would be used
externally – if purchased. A long and exhaustive timeline of hacking
tools acquisitions – including attempts – has emerged in our study,
encompassing vendors, resellers, and national and international
developers. More recently, it was revealed by the newspaper *O Globo*
that ABIN had a contract with the company Cognyte to acquire a tool
called FirstMile, which exploited breaches in the Signalling System 7
(SS7) protocol^10^ in order to collect location information of
citizens.^11^

That landscape suggested that newspapers were sparsely reporting on the
existence of disproportionate surveillance cases, especially based on
contractual agreements between vendors and the Brazilian government,
that needed to be systematized and scrutinized. Our aim, in that case,
was to offer a big picture of the ‘government hacking’ industry and
political economy dynamics^12^ in Brazil – the involvement in cases of
corruption, unjustified surveillance, and, lastly, the lack of
regulation that paves the way for these procedures to take place in the
country. As shown in this chapter, the pictured environment takes
advantage of administrative breaches that go back to a dictatorship
heritage that puts intelligence activities away from democratic
oversight and challenge the effectiveness of our national transparency
regime.

However, considering this global and political scenario, Pegasus has
become the main news in the field of surveillance worldwide. That led us
to two main hypotheses: (*a*) commercial agreements were in place for
many years between a diversity of vendors and Brazilian authorities;
(*b*) these surveillance tools, which aimed at extracting data and, as
spywares, remotely exploiting vulnerabilities, were being used widely
and contemporarily in national territory, in both law enforcement and
intelligence spheres, without the requisite judicial and administrative
procedure. As the documentation of such agreements was scarce, our
objective was to shine a light on the reach of such tools within the
organizational investigative structure in Brazil. With that, we aimed to
contribute with meaningful data to provide inputs to the making of a
proper legal framework that would address such activities with proper
assessments considering both government needs and the safeguards of
fundamental rights.

Bearing this political and investigative scenario in mind, we published
the study *Mercadores da Insegurança: conjuntura e riscos do hacking
governamental no Brasil* (Merchants of Insecurity: Conjecture and Risks
of Government Hacking in Brazil).^13^ We had two approaches: an
empirical phase, using the Transparency Portals and Requests for
Information (RFI), where we explored the state of affairs related to the
debate on government hacking – the exploitation of vulnerabilities in
systems and software by government agents to access information that
was, until then, inaccessible because of encryption – historically
linked to a supposed solution to the clash between increased encryption
deployment and the alleged impossibility of investigative agents
accessing protected evidence (known as the ‘going dark’ problem).^14^ We
then qualitatively analysed the content of the collected documentation,
exploring the transparency regime in Brazil and a culture and heritage
of secrecy concerning intelligence and law enforcement forces. In a
later phase, we analysed the legal framework in Brazil concerning the
use of surveillance tools to assess the legality, proportionality, and
necessity of this specific practice.^15^

The outcomes and the experience of research itself put in evidence at
least two apparently contradictory problems: on the one hand, the
transparency regime in Brazil, in theory, organizes and creates
technical instruments for citizens to exercise their political rights
and demand public entities to comply with their responsibilities,
especially based on the oversight of public contracts and spendings; on
the other hand, the history of secrecy concerning public security and
intelligence sectors makes their activities transparency-proof,
contributing for a state of public unawareness and possible
arbitrariness against several sectors of society. In this chapter, in
light of our findings concerning the use of hacking tools, we aim to
critically explore the development of a national transparency, the
limits it faces regarding the historical culture of secrecy of public
institutions such as the Brazilian intelligence service, and how it
reflects on the ecosystem of exploiting security vulnerabilities as a
‘legitimate’ procedure that can pose high risks to fundamental rights.

With the political background painted, we have developed the chapter in
four main sections: First, we offer an overview of our study, including
motivations, methods, findings, and critical conclusions. Then we
describe the challenges we have faced when trying to access, through
official channels and open government data portals, data related to the
subject of our study, namely information regarding contracts with
hacking tools’ vendors. Furthermore, in order to contextualize the
Brazilian political landscape and give a historical perspective to
institutions and rights fundamentally dealt with by our experience, we
analyse the development of the transparency regime of Brazil and the
culture of secrecy inherited from the Brazilian dictatorship period,
especially regarding intelligence services. We conclude by stating that,
contemporarily, these are two contradictory spheres and that the
evolving adoption of hacking tools, without proper regulation,
democratic oversight, as well as effective transparency mechanisms, will
fertilize a soil that germinates surveillance abuses and violations of
fundamental rights in the country.

# Our Study: General Motivations, Methodology, Findings, Challenges, and Conclusions

In order to fill the terms of this debate with empirical data, we
initially carried out an extensive survey based on quantitative
research, encompassing data from the period between 2015 and 2021 of
contracts between commercial representatives (either developers or
vendors) and the public administration in Brazil. This effort consisted
in carrying out approximately 60 *pedidos de acesso à informação*
(access to information requests, PAI), the main legal mechanism for
requesting information from the public sector under the Law of Access to
Information of 2011 (LAI). That included requests to the Ministry of
Justice and Public Security, Ministry of Defence, Institutional Security
Cabinet (Gabinete de Segurança Institucional, GSI), Federal Police, and
Federal Prosecutor’s Office, to all 27 secretaries of public security,
and to all 27 public prosecutor’s offices at the state level. In
parallel, an extensive survey of contractual documents was carried out
with previously identified companies: 28 transparency portals were
analysed, including all 26 portals of the executive branch of the
federal states concerning their public security secretaries as well as
of the Federal District, and the transparency portal of the federal
government. In the second phase of the research, we reviewed critical
literature in the field – unfortunately just a few of them produced in
Brazil – and analysed, based on qualitative parameters, the information
found in the contracts in order to look at three central pillars
necessary to understand their use by government authorities: security
parameters, legal basis (or conditions) for the use of the tools, and
rules concerning the chain of custody.

Among our findings, we identified 209 contractual documents at different
levels of the executive and judiciary branches, including all
state-level public security entities. The companies found in the work
were Cellebrite, Micro Systemation AB (MSAB), OpenText, Magnet
Forensics, Exterro/AccessData,^16^ and Verint
Systems/Cognyte/Suntech,^17^ including the two main commercial proxies
in Brazil – Techbiz Forense Digital and Apura Comércio de Softwares e
Assessoria em Tecnologia da Informação – and 20 different solutions
acquired by public entities.^18^ In terms of values, with monetary
correction made in November 2023, we saw a growth of 168 per cent in
federal spendings regarding such tools and of 514 per cent at the state
level. The major part of the analysed database came from information
present in the transparency portals, since the vast majority of
responses to PAI were totally or mostly negative. The justifications
given were based on legal hypotheses of secrecy of public information or
even the allegation of non-existence of such contracts and/or
technologies.

*Institutional Reach of Hacking Tools and Involvement with *

## Corruption Cases

The capillarity of tools illustrated in the contracts we found even
points to the existence of data extraction tools in agencies that,
typically, do not conduct criminal investigations using cutting-edge
forensic techniques. This is the case of the existence of a contract for
the acquisition of UFED Touch^19^ by the Administrative Council for
Economic Defence (CADE),^20^ the body typically responsible for, among
other attributions, conducting administrative processes and promoting
policies regarding fairness in commercial competition.^21^ The entity’s
management report for the year 2021 reaffirms the acquisition of the
tool for the ‘prosecution of infractions to the economic order’, in the
amount of more than half a million reais.

One of the contracts, concerning the G12 technology,^22^ developed by
Verint Systems, was acquired by the Polícia Civil from the state of Pará
for 5,000,000,00 reais,^23^ and used in the scheme of the governor of
the Pará, Helder Barbalho, to spy on investigators of a supposed
corruption scheme in which the governor was involved in the purchase of
respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic.^24^ In another investigation
by the Brazilian Federal Police, the ‘Operação Chabu’,^25^ one of
Suntech’s partners, José Augusto Alves, was arrested on suspicion of
being the central organizer, alongside with two other chiefs of police
and a police officer of the Federal Highway Police, of an information
leak scheme of secret criminal investigations concerning corrupt
politicians, the selling of Suntech products, and the exchange of
personal benefits.

Another data about the rooted presence of such companies in Brazil
relates to how they benefit from military expeditions. In 2016, the
state of Rio de Janeiro was targeted with federal military intervention
to deal with structural public security violence.^26^ According to the
transparency portal, Verint Systems is among the 10 companies most
financially favoured by the military intervention.^27^ A survey
conducted by the newspaper *Brasil de Fato* points to Verint as the
number one favoured company, with more than 40 million reais paid with
public resources for the ‘provision of data security and espionage
solutions’.^28^ In a 2015 army report, contracting with Verint for the
acquisition of electronic warfare support measures (MAGE) was already
mentioned.

## Brief (Lack of) Legal Framework and the Legitimization of a Grey Market 

As the objective of this chapter is not to exhaustively analyse each of
these law’s frameworks, the general conclusion is that none of the
regulations establish comprehensive requirements based on legality,
proportionality, and necessity to grant to government authorities the
legal basis to conduct hacking operations, whether they are for law
enforcement or intelligence activities. We analysed these findings
through the lens of existing legislation, especially the *Law of
Interception of Telecommunication*, 1996;^29^ the *Statute for Child and
Adolescents*, 1990;^30^ the *Law of Organized Crimes*, 1998;^31^ the
*Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet*, 2014;^32^ the
*General Data Protection Law*, 2018;^33^ and the *Code of Criminal
Procedure*, 2010,^34^ which we understand to be the set of laws that
currently compose the regulatory framework for hacking procedures. Our
conclusion is that both the culture of using such high-risk surveillance
tools – highly engaged in an international grey market of
vulnerabilities^35^ – and the lack of proper protections sedimented in
fundamental rights contemporary to our digital realities^36^ broaden the
space for arbitrariness and authoritarian behaviour. Additionally, it
poses risks to democratic participation and networked security in the
country, especially portrayed in the persecution and harassment of
activists and political figures, as the international panorama
shows.^37^

Therefore, the use of these tools is accelerating and being legitimized
by the government, gaining the status of proxies^38^ or procured
authorities, in terms of both diffusion and the technical power of
intrusion. They also circumvent security mechanisms of existing devices
on targets, such as strong encryption.

If not properly addressed based on risk assessments and transparency
protocols, the situation – as well as the scenario of insecurity due to
the presence of this unregulated industry^39^ and the commercial circuit
of hacking tools in Brazil, ‘legitimized’ by government demands for
forensic technologies – poses risks to rights associated with data
protection and the secrecy of communications.

Despite the alarming findings, the process of collecting, processing,
and analysing the data was illustrative of how access to information on
surveillance infrastructures is a huge political and operational
challenge. The structure of passive and active transparency, further
specified later, was insufficient, and there is a lack of incentives for
better implementation of the transparency policy. From offline sites to
the almost complete lack of standardization to the disregard for the
*Access to Information Act* of 2011 and the *Transparency Act* of 2009,
in addition to the large and easily manipulated use of exceptions not to
disclose information because of national security reasons that the
Brazilian dictatorship has inherited, it becomes clear that there is a
long way to go for a more effective oversight mechanism for controlling
state resources and practices concerning hacking procedures in Brazil.

**The Ethnography of Accessing Surveillance Data: **

# An Empirical Maze Experience within Our Findings

## The Case of Transparency Portals

As said before, the research had two approaches based on surveys: one by
searches through the public Portais de Transparência (Transparency
Portals), enacted by the Decree nº 5.482/2005 and which, theoretically,
makes available to every citizen detailed data on public spendings. We
sought to investigate in these portals (totalling 28: 26 secretaries of
public security at state level, the secretary of public security of the
federal district, and the federal government’s transparency portal)
contractual documents concerning hacking tools that once were, or at the
time of the research were, in use in Brazil.^40^

To look at the portals, we first tried to carry out the searches by
inserting keywords such as ‘extraction’, ‘access to mobile devices’,
‘mobile data extraction’, ‘remote access to digital devices’,
‘decryption tools’, and so on. The outcomes were not considerable
enough, making it necessary to rethink the keywords used. We assumed
that looking for an exact subject of contractual documents would lead us
to an unbearable uncertainty: every company has its own name for its
products and for its capabilities. As a solution, we shortlisted a set
of 32 companies that were active in the global commercial trading of
hacking tools with governments, mentioned in news, mapped by other key
stakeholders, or outspoken in the security market. A second reason not
to look at functionalities was that the international vendors were
‘routing’ their tools through resellers in Brazil.

We also found public documents, available on Google, informing
acquisitions of Cellebrite tools by various government bodies – whether
security departments or state public prosecutions. It is important to
remark that the documents highlighted the exclusive resale of
*Cellebrite*’s UFED tool by a Brazilian company called *TechBiz Forense
Digital*. Due to this exclusivity, the modality commonly used for public
acquisitions in which there is no competition – as in this case for
exclusivity – are carried out through a *non-enforceability of public
bidding*,^41^ meaning less public information that government bodies
were looking for companies to hire.

From that moment on, we began searching for the names of suppliers to
state and federal governments, as well as public prosecutions. We
highlight findings of two reseller Brazilian companies: *TechBiz Forense
Digital* and *Apura Comércio de Softwares e Assessoria Em Tecnologia da
Informação*. For other international companies, such as *Verint
Systems*, they have local subsidiaries – in this case, the *Suntech
S.A.*, later renamed *Cognyte Brasil S.A.* It showed how surveillance
companies often change their names to get off the radar of political
scandals and that was also the case in Brazil.^42^

That has posed challenges for us to trace contracts and to find a
‘corporate’ relationship between *Verint Systems*, *Suntech S.A*., and
*Cognyte Brasil S.A*. We observed that there was a relationship between
*Suntech* and *Verint*, in which the former was a company belonging to
the Israeli group. However, during the survey of *Cognyte* *Brasil*
tools, we observed that the National Register of Legal Entities (CNPJ),
which was used to identify companies as well as their official emails,
was the same as that of *Suntech*. When observing the history of
*Verint*, we discover that there was a separation between the
intelligence sector – which became *Cognyte* – and the business
solutions sector, which kept the name *Verint*. Finally, we noticed that
the negotiations made directly with *Verint* were carried out only at
the federal level, while acquisitions of its solutions at the state
level were carried out through its subsidiary. As a result, relevant
international hacking companies find ways to camouflage themselves in
the domestic market through resellers or founding a subsidiary with
national representatives that has tighter relationships with Brazilian
authorities.

Another field of difficulties concerns the process of standardization of
the portals. There is no standardization, from the user experience
perspective, in the way the searches are carried out – which disrespect
common requirements in open data guidelines worldwide.^43^ The vendor
search could be either on the homepage or hidden within the portal’s
architecture. It was necessary to learn and relearn with each new portal
the engines and paths leading to a given contract. In addition, it was
not uncommon for us to find problems on the websites, such as being out
of order or being incompatible with browsers.

This experience report on Transparency Portals demonstrates several ways
in which, in reality, opacity seems to be the rule, both for political
and technical reasons. In a considerable number of cases, the dashboard
of contracts had only generic terms, such as metadata which had
descriptions that did not inform the exact product being purchased, any
documents available, or the amount spent. When the documents were
available – when there were any – we had a real notion of the equipment
acquired by the government. The lack of standardization of websites, for
example, of different states, demonstrates another way of making access
to information more difficult. The cultural concealment practices make
it more difficult for citizens to oversee state expenditures, their
legalities, and consequently confront authorities.

## The Case of the Requests for Information (RFI)

The process of requesting information through the LAI was equally
difficult and substantially less productive than using the transparency
portals. Requests were made to the secretariats responsible for public
security policies in the 27 federative entities, as well as to the
respective public prosecutor’s offices (MPEs) of each state and the
public prosecutor’s offices at the federal level (MPFs). In addition,
requests were sent to federal agencies such as the Federal Police, the
Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Justice and Public Security, and
the Institutional Security Office, the institutional body responsible
for the Brazilian intelligence agency.

Except for the federal agencies, which use the ‘FalaBr’ platform, all
other entities use their own portals to request public information –
which, if not standardized, configures a very dispersed fragmentation of
means through which citizens get in contact with the public power. All
these other entities use the Citizen Information Systems (SICs), and, in
order to access them, registration in each one of them is required. Some
of these websites only allowed registration after screening, making the
process even slower. Therefore, the first step was to register on all
the aforementioned SICs and wait for confirmation, which sometimes took
several days.

This first step led to another problem: the number of messages sent from
the platforms, ranging from the confirmation email request to the
confirmation of completed registration, including the communication of
the registered RFIs and, later on, their receipt by the agency. Not
rarely, the requests were forwarded to other agencies who did not
respond to the requests. The notifications of deadline extension for
responding to the information request were also very frequent.
Eventually, the requests were answered; but even after that, they
continued the communication, whether for archiving our requests or for
‘citizens’ satisfaction’ surveys. In this back and forth, there were 195
communications from the SICs in the inbox of the registered email.
However, these were only the remaining ones, as all the initial emails
sent for account request and confirmation were deleted. In other words,
these 195 emails were only after the completion of the PAI. This entire
paragraph serves to highlight a concerning phenomenon: when transparency
is buried under an excess of information. Furthermore, the interface is
not user-friendly. On the contrary, it often required reading multiple
pages of bureaucratic protocol messages to find, within one of them,
what was new in that PAI that prompted the email.

We have also identified a constant problem: the low quality of the
systems of public service. In one state, for example, an expired
security certificate made it impossible to track the information request
for months. In another case, one of the systems asked for a set of
information that would allow the requester to be identified, which is
not legally mandatory, as any citizen should be able to request
information while keeping their identity anonymous.

Furthermore, there was usually the option to deny, respond, or extend
the deadline for providing the requested information. However, in a
strangely convenient manner for the agencies, the denials came in
external documents, without the possibility of appealing within the same
protocol. This meant that appealing the denial involved, in these cases,
an additional effort of collecting documents from the respective systems
as well as the original questions in order to file a new request
appealing against the denial. In other cases, the very redaction of the
denials of different authorities (for example, secretaries of public
security of different states, such as Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte,
and Roraima, as well as the Ministry of Justice and Public Security)
were literally the same – which points to a possible coordinated
response to our requests.

These problems, however, are parallel or, if viewed as more intentional,
complementary to a more or less planned opacity. Neglect, carelessness,
and laziness – are they political strategies or operational accidents?

# A Necessary Step Back: A Chronology of the National Transparency Regime in Brazil and its Barriers

The institutionalization of a national transparency policy in Brazil
occurred gradually over the last 20 years, especially with the federal
decree that enacted the *Law of Access to Information* in 2011. The LAI
encouraged the implementation of technical guidelines for active
transparency – that is, data made available despite any request – and
passive transparency – that is, disclosure of information not initially
available, based on citizens’ request^44^ – and has been referenced not
only by scholars^45^ and by a significant part of civil society^46^ as a
fundamental tool for the effective instrumentalization of the inspection
of public governmental activities, but also considered a reference from
an international standing point.^47^ That comes from a long-established
importance concerning the democratic instruments’ access to information
to advance the effectiveness of human rights in the country and to shift
the long-term censorship rule of law inherited from the military
dictatorship period.^48^ Nowadays, the set of instruments that
configures the national transparency policy is transversal to
contemporary struggles towards different variations of social
justice,^49^ including the memory of disappeared political dissidents by
the time of the dictatorship,^50^ environment preservation agendas,^51^
military activities,^52^ corruption in the public sector,^53^ and
surveillance technologies’ programmes, the *locus* of our study.

At first sight, the chronology of the development of a national
transparency policy in Brazil suggests a substantial proportion and
implementation of this agenda by the past, at least, four president
administrations in order to gradually build a set of government
initiatives that would provide tools for public oversight. In 2003, it
founded the Forum for the Right to Access to Public Information (Fórum
do Direito ao Acesso à Informação). In 2004, it was created the
Transparency Portal (Portal de Transparência) of the Federal Government
– the most substantial policy of active transparency. In 2009, it
enacted the Complementary Law (Lei Complementar) nº 131/2009 that
altered the text of the Law of Fiscal Responsibility (Lei de
Responsabilidade Fiscal) to determine the continuous availability of
detailed information about the execution of the public budget. In 2011,
a federal decree created the LAI, a landmark regulation that
consolidated the transparency regime in Brazil.^54^ In 2016, it created
the Open Government Partnership, an arrangement between civil society
and the government to provide data on human rights violations and
corruption, access to quality environment data, and so on, having Brazil
as one of its founding members. And, finally, there was the regulation
of the Open Data Policy that took place in 2016. According to the Global
Information Rating, an initiative that assesses legal frameworks for the
right to information globally, Brazil appears in the 28th position,
among 139 countries.^55^

Concerning the LAI, the set of guidelines that creates the foundation of
the national transparency regime, consolidated in the law, is based on
key principles and fundamental rights established in the federal
constitution. Among them are Article 5, XIV^56^ and XXXIII;^57^ Article
37, caput, and §3, II;^58^ as well as Article 216^59^ that underline the
fundamental principles that must guide the public administration, among
them the principle of publicity of administrative acts.^60^ According to
Orion Augusto Platt Neto, Flávio da Cruz, Sandra Rolim Ensslin, and
Leonardo Ensslin,^61^ the principle of publicity underlines the notion
that the people have the right to know about the acts practised by the
public administration so that they can exercise social control and
democratic power. To that extent, a strict dialogue is built together
with the ‘principle of the supremacy of the public interest over the
private’, typical and foundational of the dogmatic doctrine of
administrative law.^62^

The general rule^63^ concerning the disclosure of public information
defines, as well, exceptions based on which public authorities are not
obliged to turn over the requested data. A mosaic of legal exceptions
can also be drawn – and, for the purposes of our study, was definitive
for the public authorities not to hand over the information required and
classify documents about the use of hacking tools. Based on the LAI, for
example, Article 7, §1, states that it is not mandatory for public
entities to provide information whose secrecy is necessary to the safety
of society or the state.^64^ Nevertheless, some questions remain: What
are the specific parameters for a public entity to conceal information?
How do they assess if the information is of public interest or could
endanger national security? Would the simple appointment of a
*dispositif* of a law be enough in order to justify for the information
to be classified, or further and more qualified justification would be
necessary?

*From Theory to Reality: Three Dimensions of Limits to *

## Transparency Effectiveness

Although we can argue, on the one hand, that this legal framework
establishes an ideally proportional and legitimate general rule, on the
other hand, the political practice faces challenges that contribute to
the continuous effort of the public sector to remain opaque concerning
meaningful and public-interest information, which becomes even more
noticeable when it comes to surveillance activities.

It becomes clearer that the legal framework deals with a collision of
principles in the trajectory of the transparency policy in Brazil,^65^
having on the one side a claim for structural changes for the disclosure
of information – brought about by civil society organizations and
members of the legislative branch – and on the other side an effort to
uphold public information pushed by public sectors related to the armed
forces^66^ and law enforcement activities.^67^

With that background, we highlight three dimensions of limits to the
effectiveness of the LAI that have appeared as barriers for the
achievement of an effective transparency landscape in the country,
especially when the focus is the use of surveillance tools by state
actors, and more specifically about hacking tools. The first of these
dimensions relies on a misleading understanding of the rule of law with
the instrumentalization of the Brazilian General Data Protection Law
(LGPD) of 2020, with the objective of systematically denying access to
information of public interest.^68^ Based on this rationality, for
instance, the Military Police recently denied the access to salary
information of a policeman suspected of the murder of the city
counsellor and human rights activist Marielle Franco and her driver
Anderson Gomes^69^ in 2018, because the information would supposedly
violate the privacy of the suspect. During Bolsonaro’s administration,
the GSI (directly attached to the presidency) also denied access
information,^70^ requested via the LAI, about who has visited the
Palácio do Planalto (where the official office of the president is
located), based on a misleading supposition that it would violate the
LGPD,^71^ just to name a few cases.

Second, another dimension points to a structural and historical problem
regarding an apparent clash between the regulation of the intelligence
service due to the nature of intelligence activities – which naturally
requires a sufficiently secure degree of secrecy for the effectiveness
of the activity – and the reported inefficiency of intelligence
accountability bodies, such as the Joint Committee for the Control of
Intelligence Activities (Comissão Mista de Controle das Atividades de
Inteligência, CCAI).^72^ This is fuelled by two other layers of opacity,
typical from the intellectual property protections granted to services
and technologies traded with the international market and deployed for
public– private partnerships. First, companies could not be obliged to
provide access to the architecture of their systems because of
proprietary rights – although they contract with public actors – and,
second, the very content of the public contract instruments – such as
the service hired or tool acquired, the budget, their purposes, and
their functions – fall under secrecy classifications since they, in
theory, could jeopardize ‘national’ or ‘state’ security.^73^

Finally, there is another legal dimension, characterized by the ‘abuse
of right’ (*abuso de direito*)^74^ that makes excessive and default use
of exceptions in order to not provide the requested data. This is in
addition to when the requests are simply ignored – a problem we can call
a systematic ‘bureaucratic disobedience’.^75^ That means generalist
denials of information without pointing out legal basis or
justifications, non-compliance with strict deadlines provided by the
LAI, or even a total absence of responses to our requests – which
happens to be not circumstantial in the case of information requested to
law enforcement agencies.^76^ The denials do not have to be applied to
the entire content of documents requested (they can, for instance,
classify specific sensitive sections) and, if not disclosed at all, they
have to be meaningfully seasoned, exposing reasons that base the risk
assessment to, for example, national or state security.

In the case of our study, the last two problems – secrecy culture of
opaqueness regarding intelligence activities and bureaucratic
disobedience – appeared as structural barriers that have been
instrumentalized by the inquired public institutions so that they do not
have to comply with the RFI. Also, it is very symptomatic that some of
the terms of classification were elaborated after our RFI, meaning that
the requested information was not classified by the time of the inquiry.
While platforms have been developing justified threat assessments that
facilitate security claims when deploying privacy-enhancing
technologies, such as strong encryption. In the same way, government
authorities have to justify, also based on threat assessments, their
adoption of secrecy policies that block access to information and
mandatory transparency provisions.

For example, when the Secretary of Security of the states of Goiás, São
Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro were asked about the existence of such tools
and conditions for their use, the denial to grant the documents was
based on the Term of Information Classification Information (Termo de
Classificação de Informação, TCIs), a legal provision that states the
justification for the denial, based on national security reasons, for
instance. Nevertheless, several of the TCIs were signed *after* the
RFIs. It is possible to conclude that the public conduct points to a
systemic disrespect of due administrative process regarding the
decision-making procedure about the classification of public-interest
critical documents.

Although all the aforementioned challenges compose a networked political
mosaic that breaks a further development of the enforcement of a
national transparency policy, the last two political arrangements in
particular illustratively suggest barriers concerning a democratic
institutional that could lead to effective oversight and accountability
necessities of intelligence services based on the LAI.

**A Second Step Back: The Heritage and Oversight **

**of Intelligence Activities in Brazil as a Structural **

# Problem

Accessing information on government actions is considered a necessary
condition to keeping the citizens’ will within government
activities.^77^ In the context of compatibilizing such
representativeness with the necessary autonomy governments need to act,
mechanisms of control and oversight, especially of intelligence
agencies, and activities tend to be fragile and uncertain, as Marco
Cepik^78^ states. External control is necessary to ensure both the
accountability and the responsibility of governments to citizens, but
such a requirement enters in a route collision with the secrecy culture
that constitutes the intelligence sector.^79^ As Cepik reminds us, the
problem is that opacity is a pervasive trait of intelligence activities.
Thus, such phenomena enter in conflict with the transparency of
government actions, which is one of the most defended requisites of
contemporaneous political practice and ‘democracy principal not
fulfilled promise’.^80^ Secrecy, as Edward Shils defines, is a
compulsory retention of knowledge, secured by sanctions and legal
penalties. Shils points out the intentionality and the regulatory
elements of secrecy. Such specificity would be useful to define ‘public
secrecy’. Taking from Kim Lane Scheppele, there would be five
information categories regulated by public secrecy: national defence,
external policy, judicial process, intellectual property and patents,
and citizens’ privacy.^81^

Observing the federal intelligence services in Brazil, especially from
the time frame that has the military dictatorship period in Brazil as
the reference (1964– 1985), a political and institutional heritage from
that time can be perceived and suggests the contemporary fragility of
the oversight of such activities. Between 1964 and 1985, the
intelligence services were mostly operated by the National Service of
Information (Serviço Nacional de Informação, SNI),^82^ under the
Doctrine of National Security (Doutrina de Segurança Nacional).^83^ In
1975, the National System of Information (Sistema Nacional de
Informação, SISNI) was created and designed to process information.
Historically, the intelligence system was focused on political
oppositionists, such as anarchists and leftists.^84^ The set of human
rights violations during the period is widely documented,^85^ and the
role played by the intelligence system also contributed to the
surveillance and persecution of victims of the dictatorship.^86^

During the re-democratization period and, consequently, with the
formation of the Constituent Assembly responsible for drafting the
federal constitution of 1988, a set of negotiations were made for a
gradual transition from the military to a democracy regime.^87^ Although
the SNI was extinguished and it became the actual Brazilian Intelligence
Agency (Agência Brasileira de Inteligência, ABIN), with intelligence
services being expected to count on civil control,^88^ the regulation of
intelligence services was not consistently addressed and remained
employing a military modus operandi.^89^ The Law nº 9.883/1999
instituted the Brazilian System of Intelligence (SISBIN) together with
the ABIN, and, only 14 years later, Resolution nº 2/2013 has regulated
the external control body, the CCAI, created in 2000 and composed by
parliamentarians of the Federal Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.^90^

The oversight arrangement of intelligence activities is composed by
internal and external bodies.^91^ We focus, nevertheless, on the
external aspect of it, based on the legislative control through the CCAI
as a means to underline the participatory and transparency levels (or
the lack of them) of social control. The work of the CCAI has been
broadly documented as ineffective.^92^ Cepik^93^ raises two hypotheses
for the historical low effectiveness of the committee: first, the lack
of expertise of the member-congressmen, together with the lack of
attention to such thematic by the electorate, which leads them not to be
sufficiently involved; second, the tendency of the congressmen to be
easily co-opted by members of military forces, leading to a cordial
relationship between the CCAI and members of the intelligence service,
which can jeopardize the necessary distance for a democratic and
impersonal oversight to take place. According to a former analyst of the
ABIN, there is no criticism to be made about the oversight of the
intelligence in Brazil because it simply does not exist.^94^ The reports
made annually by CCAI are also not accessible to the public, making it
impossible to assess their activities from a social perspective.

Carl von Clausewitz^95^ points to the necessity of an informational
asymmetry, which can be transformed for military and war advantages, or,
in other words, power imbalances. However, if intelligence activities
are occurring in democratic contexts, who can be the enemies? Which
groups, organizations, and individuals could be surveilled?
Additionally, it seems that citizens’ privacy is less and less protected
by public secrecy as law enforcement agencies and the intelligence
sector gain more and more informational powers over everyday life
through intrusive tools of digital forensics, spyware, or something
similar. Such an offensive against citizens’ privacy seems to place them
in the position of enemies, which is coherent with a growing tendency of
securitization and militarization of modern society.

The work of law enforcement in Brazil is also very problematic and
widely documented in literature as institutionalized racism, militarism,
and a systematic violator of human rights.^96^ In terms of numbers, in
2021 there were 6,145 deaths as a result of police interventions. These
forces also have an authoritarian past and present, as they were
important pieces of military dictatorship that took place in 1964 and
lasted more than two decades. Nowadays, there are systematic cases of
police abuse,^97^ including torture, formation of militias,^98^ and
illegal surveillance.^99^ These abusive tendencies in Brazilian police
forces include systematic practices of privacy violations^100^ and
opacity.^101^

# Conclusion

In the first two sections, we showed that our study analysed the
institutional relations between the Brazilian state and hacking tool
vendors, internationally and nationally, offering also a political
panorama of the phenomena worldwide. We found several contracts that
encompass data extraction technologies and remote hacking. Our two first
hypotheses – that commercial agreements were in place for many years
between a diversity of vendors and Brazilian authorities, and that these
surveillance tools aimed to extract data and remotely exploit
vulnerabilities, including spywares, were being used widely in the
national territory, in both law enforcement and intelligence spheres –
were proved. Qualitatively and quantitatively, we were able to find 219
contractual instruments that showed that there is an ecosystem of
hacking tools operating in Brazil, configuring a political economy
crucial for but also enabled by Brazilian law enforcement authorities,
making it a more established, unregulated international market of
vulnerabilities and legitimized by a diversity of public actors.
Although not the focus of this chapter, we also concluded that the
country does not count on a modern and resilient legal framework that
takes into account modern concerns with privacy, data protection, and
cybersecurity.

In sections three and four, we spoke about the transparency regime and
the historical opacity of intelligence services in Brazil, which became
clear in our empirical research. The experience of instrumentalizing the
access to information tools, from transparency portals to requests for
information, showed that the due administrative process disrespects
deadlines regularly, is broadly generic when denying data, and has
little standardization. Some of the ‘terms of classification’ of
documents were also done just after the requests for information in many
cases, and the very information in the dashboard of portals was very
scarce, leaving just metadata that would not grant meaningful
information for a democratic oversight by civil society, academics, or
even control bodies within the government. It was also clear that the
oversight of intelligence and law enforcement activities is far from
being lawfully accessible to citizens and control bodies, such as the
CCAI. That maintains and even broadens the margin for opaque
surveillance activities, from right to privacy and freedom of
expression, association, manifestation, and cybersecurity. As we pointed
out, transparency has not been fully achieved in Brazil.

On matters of security policies, the scenario is even worse. The
legitimate monopoly of violence is often considered the foundation of
the modern state as it is essential to exercise control over a
population and territory.^102^ Thus, managing effective social control
over it is probably one of the biggest challenges to securing the right
to transparency within modern democracies. It is somewhat ironic or
tragic that while access information can even be considered essential to
democratic regimes, it is systematically denied to citizens. ‘All states
have been “information societies”, since the generation of state power
presumes reflexively monitored system reproduction, involving the
regularized gathering, storage, and control of information applied to
administrative ends.’^103^ In this chapter, we pointed out how difficult
it can be to effectively access information about the methods and tools
of information collection and production that are easily available to
law enforcement agencies.

The conclusion is that, even with a well-recognized transparency regime,
Brazil still lacks the means to enable its proper implementation in the
real world. Further research, advocacy, and policymaking work must be
done to align the country with the world’s best transparency standards,
improving and respecting not only the legality, proportionality, and
necessity principles in the field of surveillance infrastructures but
also in every government activity that can negatively impact individual
and collective autonomy. Although our case study was based on Brazil and
this was not a comparative-oriented work, the tensions between opacity
and transparency can also be further explored through the lens of
experiences in other countries, including investigative journalists,
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) or civil society, and researchers.

    unauthorized access to information, whether communication or data at
    rest or in transit; second, from a behavioural point of view, this
    exploitation involves intentionality,
