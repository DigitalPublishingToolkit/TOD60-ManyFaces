# Re-Conceptualizing Governance Policies on Data Access for Research 

# *Carolina Aguerre*

The last decade has seen an expansion of scholars who are increasingly
interested in questioning the current data governance arrangements, its
politics, and the very foundations of knowledge and power against the
dominance of Big Tech platforms.^1^ Much of this literature has claimed
that the power harnessed by these organizations should be addressed
practically and politically, through resistance strategies as well as
through policies, including regulation. Yet often it claims that this is
not only old wine in new bottles but rather that the nature of this
power deserves a special epistemological status.

The notion of ‘data interest’ as one that constitutes a need and value
of data as a resource is found in different sectors, including the
scientific, and involves design and governance practices.^2^ Access to
data has been a crucial and longstanding concern of academia to fulfill
its mission towards advancing science and achieving research goals.^3^
The development of the internet in the 1990s and the expansion of
digital networked technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) became
game changers for the practices of the scientific community in different
disciplinary domains.

The possibility of amassing large data troves of big data has been
possible due to the internet and the platforms and applications that
have connected layers of individuals and devices.^4^ The control of
these data troves has been well guarded in many of the large internet
platforms that have trained their algorithms with these machine learning
(ML) models. The emergence of even larger data sets that train the
algorithms of most generative AI applications is based on larger volumes
of data that are collected and analyzed from the open internet,
including platforms.^5^ Without the complementarities between different
technologies and open infrastructures, the current disruptions of
generative AI applications fostered by the private sector and many
legacy digital platforms would not have been achieved.^6^

It is well known that the tensions between data access and the interests
of global corporations are a pressing issue^7^ for governments, civil
society, researchers, and small companies, as legitimacy concerns backed
by an idea of access to data as a justice issue^8^ continue to build
up.^9^ While the Digital Services Act, 2022 (DSA), and in particular
Article 40 have played a relevant role in the debate of access to very
large platforms’ data for research over the last years, this policy
remains a regional instrument. The Digital Markets Act (DMA), 2022, and
the DSA seek to address some of the concerns that unfold between the
control of Big Tech and large and relevant data sets for society at
large. Yet it is an instrument that is notably absent in countries
outside the European Union (EU), and even more so in global majority
contexts. Despite this, it may have implications for researchers beyond
the EU and thence transnational and extraterritorial effects,^10^ as
evidenced from recent examples with EU regulation on data and
digitization.^11^

For stakeholders outside of the potential scope of these measures, there
are different initiatives which have treated data access issues for
scientific endeavours. These actions embrace different objectives and
have been developed by national and supranational organizations with
varying degrees of formality, binding nature, and scale over the last
decade. National open data strategies, open science (OS)
recommendations, and AI strategies are different policies that address
data access as a key pillar to achieving different policy goals. Despite
the claims made by these policies concerning data access options, these
strategies are much more elusive concerning issues of access to data by
the research community. For example, OS promotes the open sharing of
scientific knowledge, including research data, and open data initiatives
aim to make data accessible to the public, including researchers and AI
practitioners. By providing open access to relevant datasets, open data
may facilitate the development and training of AI models by local groups
of researchers. While these claims may seem legitimate, these policy
approaches do not always facilitate these objectives. This is largely
because they are still disconnected policy instruments, but also because
in many countries in global majority contexts, research and innovation
is still an aspiration rather than a well-defined and consistent
policy.^12^ Though the general objectives and the actors for both OS and
(national) AI strategies are different, there are some overlaps and a
notorious common interest in having access to data.

The dispersed features around digital data policies are characteristics
of polycentric governance and governing. Polycentric theories address
how scattered sites of governance function, or not.^13^ The first
theoretical developments concerning polycentric governance occurred with
Michael Polanyi in 1951, when he studied science and the evolution of
species along the lines of selforganization. Science as such was one of
the first locus of polycentric governance conceptualizations.
Polycentric theorizing later evolved into the well-known frameworks
developed by Vincent and Elinor Ostrom, which addressed the different
types of goods, mainly those of a public good nature that tend not to
exclude its uses. Many of these are related with natural resource
management. This provides a relevant analogy with the recent but
contentious analogies of data as a natural resource.^14^ Yet it is still
relevant to acknowledge since it underscores the factiousness around
data governance, including issues of data ownership, access,
appropriation, protection, and management, which are all central to the
tensions of natural resources.

In the context of the consolidated power of Big Tech,^15^ it seems
counterintuitive to ascertain digital data governance as polycentric.
Yet, as developed by Kate Crawford, ‘this large-scale capture (of data)
has become so fundamental to the AI field that it is unquestioned. So
how did we get here? What ways of conceiving data have facilitated this
stripping of context, meaning, and specificity? … What forms of power do
these approaches enhance and enable?’^16^ How are these data-capture
practices enabling certain forms of knowledge? What would expanding
access to data mean for researchers in the context of increasing
expansion of AI and more centres of power, authority, and legitimacy?

This chapter’s fundamental objective is to discuss how access to data
for research is being framed in different policy initiatives with an
international reach and how should they evolve. There is a normative
orientation that is concerned with this evolution, since there is an
understanding that there are gaps to be attended to promote more
equitable, just, and sustainable arrangements for the have-nots for
science and research when data is out of reach for so many actors
outside of Big Tech. More specifically, this chapter examines two
existing policy instruments with a large presence in different countries
and regions, with varied resources and capabilities: OS and AI
strategies. This work probes polycentric governance concepts and how
these different sites of governance and specific policy domains are a
case for advancing a multi-pronged agenda on the conditions for access
to digital data for scientific purposes.

OS initiatives and AI strategies have been chosen for their focus on
access to data for science, development, and innovation. They are also
present in many global majority countries. While open data strategies
would also potentially touch upon this concern, their focus is on
increasing government transparency and citizen and business engagement
with mostly open-sector data. As the last decade has shown in terms of
the open data movement, it is not enough for the public sector to open
data, as the private sector holds the key to the largest data sets.^17^
States in different parts of the world and different political regimes
are concerned with the asymmetries between local actors’ capacity to
develop data-driven products on the one hand and develop innovation and
economic growth on the other. That is, they have a competitive
motivation to help firms in their countries develop the production of
data-driven goods and services, and sometimes this is only possible with
the integration of science and research synergies with the local
business environment^18^ in the EU and also beyond it.^19^

The research here is based on different data sources, including analysis
of national and international policy documents concerning OS and
national and regional AI strategies and plans, nine exploratory
interviews, and participant observation in three workshops relevant to
the theme (see Appendix 2A for details). The work uses an interpretative
approach to identify and clarify meanings and understandings from
existing policies. It is complemented with thematic analysis to identify
possible integrations among themes.

The first section discusses the state of the art of the policy
developments concerning data access for research in the OS movement and
AI strategies and plans. The second section develops the conceptual
framework that will be used based on polycentric governance theorizing
in the digital field.^20^ The third elaborates on the landscape of
initiatives and themes against polycentric governing. The final section
addresses knowledge and power concerns and the way forward for this
debate.

## Access to Data for Research: OS and AI Strategies 

This section addresses two policy approaches concerning access to
digital data for scientific purposes: OS and AI strategies. Both these
instruments are found in global majority countries, though they are not
ubiquitous. Rather than contesting the status quo of digital governance
and large platforms, the ventures of OS share the concerns for data
access and inequality but are framed with the fuzzier aim of the
democratization of science. AI strategies, on the other hand, have
interest in including alternatives that promote more equitable
conditions for local actors to develop AI, and big data is a crucial
need to train deep learning algorithms, even more so with the hype of
fundamental models and generative AI applications.

### Access to Data in the OS Movement

OS rests on several definitions which embrace different scopes and
practices. New demands are emerging from academia and civil society in
relation to data access to achieve socio-economic development, advance
science beyond a corporate agenda, and address cognitive justice.^21^
Ultimately, these different approaches share a common denominator in
making knowledge development processes as open and accessible as
possible.

> Open science is defined as inclusive construct that combines various
> movements and practices aiming to make multilingual scientific
> knowledge openly available, accessible and reusable for everyone, to
> increase scientific collaborations and sharing of information for the
> benefits of science and society, and to open the processes of
> scientific knowledge creation, evaluation and communication to
> societal actors beyond the traditional scientific community.^22^

According to the UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific, and
Cultural Organization) Recommendation on Open Science, this concept
rests on the following pillars: open scientific knowledge, open science
infrastructures, science communication, open engagement of societal
actors, and open dialogue with other knowledge systems. Of relevance for
this work is the notion of open scientific knowledge, which refers to
open access to scientific publications, research data, metadata, open
educational resources, software, and source code and hardware that are
available in the public domain or under copyright and licensed under an
open licence that allows access, reuse, repurpose, adaptation, and
distribution under specific conditions, provided to all actors.^23^

Other definitions based on literature reviews define OS as ‘transparent
and accessible knowledge that is shared and developed through
collaborative networks’.^24^ The term ‘knowledge’ includes code, data,
ideas, information, scientific outputs, scientific publications, and
scientific results.^25^ Sh. Moradi and S. Abdi conceive ‘open science’
as a novel approach to science and the process of its generation,
monitoring, and dissemination, covering three sectors affected by the
notion of ‘openness’ – that which should be incorporated in research
data, in scholarly communication, and in access.^26^

The EU’s OS policy is defined as an ‘approach to the scientific process
that focuses on spreading knowledge as soon as it is available using
digital and collaborative technology’.^27^ Concerning the data
component, the European Commission requires research and innovation
funding beneficiaries to make their publications available in open
access and ‘make their data as open as possible and as closed as
necessary’, acknowledging a perennial tension of the debate concerning
intellectual property and commercialization tensions. The EU’s approach
stresses timeliness as a key attribute and added value of OS data access
policies. In the case of Latin America, the COVID-19 pandemic enhanced
the need to embrace a regional scope for OS policies.^28^ The region has
countries with strong policies concerning scientific data and access to
publications (Mexico, Peru, Argentina) and recommendations on different
OS dimensions in Chile, Brazil, Colombia, and Uruguay, particularly
within their national research agencies but which have not become
consolidated policies.^29^ Africa has the Africa Open Science Platform
(AOSP), established in 2017, which is supported by several scientific
and research authorities in South Africa and the region, such as
Bibliotheca Alexandrina. For many African countries, OS remains confined
to scientists and research networks rather than being a state
policy.^30^

Data governance practices in OS are enshrined in two sets of principles:
FAIR and CARE. The FAIR principles, meaning that data should be
findable, accessible, interoperable, and re-usable, are a cross-cutting
standard for all the data produced within the OS umbrella since they
were adopted in 2016.^31^ The publication of these principles helped
encourage practices that made OS values more visible and applicable for
data access for scientific research, and they have also been included in
open data strategies. CARE (collective benefit, authority to control,
responsibility, and ethics) principles were approved in 2019 and are
broader than FAIR but allow to frame the context and purpose of data
governance for indigenous data sovereignty,^32^ which includes
recognizing the different conceptions around science, technology, and
culture. Indigenous data sovereignty ‘refers to the right of Indigenous
Peoples to govern the collection, ownership, and application of data
about Indigenous communities, peoples, lands, and resources’.^33^ Though
the CARE principles are not invoked in the pastoralists’ struggle in
Ghana to secure their data rights (see chapter 3), they are struggling
for their own self-determination concerning their data politics and
practices.

OS has had significant effects on open access publications during the
last 20 years.^34^ Open access and open data publications are becoming
increasingly mandatory in research environments with public funding,
notably in the EU, Latin America, and Canada. Two broad approaches may
be identified in the different policies concerning the availability of
open scientific knowledge: publication in open access formats and
repositories and open data initiatives for scientific endeavours. There
are more nuanced interpretations with regard to the publication of
accessible and open data emerging from research. For example, the
Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)^35^ mapped
15 open data initiatives for open science and 6 for publications, most
of them concentrated in Europe and Latin America, the two regions where
OS is more heavily discussed and practised.^36^ There are fewer
incentives to publish open data emerging from scientific research
compared with defining the outlets for publishing in open access across
the different national and regional initiatives that have been assessed
in Latin America, Europe, and Canada.^37^

Several studies suggest that there is a lack of incentives for open
science. Even though a vast majority of scientists support open science,
few practise it, and there is a call for better enforcement.^38^ The
Registry of Open Access Repositories Mandatory Archiving Policies
(ROARMAP) is an example to redress this issue where policymakers and
funders have developed certain policies requiring that the research they
have sponsored should be released under open access and open data
conditions.

OS is approached differently, not only in diverse geographic settings
but also within stakeholders and institutions. The COVID-19 pandemic has
underscored the need for much greater collaboration among scientists,
and a shared understanding of the policies and practices, including
those related to data access, has become more urgent to help address
future global crises.^39^ The mix of concerns at the heart of the OS
movement expose the different interests, actors’ values, and normative
understandings. Research on this issue underscores the different policy
objectives on how OS is framed, ranging from open data and open access
as facilitators of OS to scientific efficiency, infrastructure enablers,
strategic advantages, the role of the private sector, beneficiaries of
OS, socio-economic progress as a response to global development and as a
model to reduce dependencies on current structures.^40^ These different
issues have multiple centres of decision-making and authority that span
national and regional science agencies, data protection authorities,
government open data policies, the private sector, academic publishers,
cloud providers, universities and research centres, and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs). Unless there are clearly defined policies,
follow-up mechanisms, and consultations processes nationally and
internationally, it can become a buzzword for cosmetic approaches on
openness in scientific practices.

### Access to Data in AI Strategies and Policies

The integration of AI systems in society has become a concern and a
priority for many governments which steer these debates in their
national contexts and embed their own vision.^41^ The so-called AI gap
is characterized by those who have the capacity to design and implement
AI applications which are largely based on computational capacity and
power, access to relevant data, and skills and knowledge in AI.^42^
Access to large amounts of high-quality data provides one of the
greatest competitive advantages under the AI paradigm.^43^

During the second half of the 2010s, a growing number of countries and
regions developed AI strategies, plans, or agendas as policy
instruments, with varying degrees of involvement and participation from
stakeholder groups outside government. AI strategies became policy
artefacts that have helped frame, prioritize, and steer actions
concerning the development, use, and regulation of AI systems in
specific contexts. The first of these policy instruments emerged in
Canada, but it was closely followed by both consolidated and emerging
economies, mostly from Asia and Latin America from 2018.^44^ In most
cases, a ‘first generation’ of strategies may be identified between the
first period between 2017 and 2020 that aimed to address many needs:
(*a*) clarification of the fastpaced changes that were being brought
about by AI systems and their potential future scenarios, and definition
of roles and responsibilities; (*b*) capacity development to coordinate
the stakeholder groups and defining the ecosystem of actors and issues
involved; and (*c*) provision of a competitive advantage to the country
and their position to compete in the ‘AI race’. A ‘second generation’ of
AI strategies was identified after 2021, when the UNESCO Recommendation
on the Ethics of AI was approved by the General Assembly of this body,
involving its 193 member states, the majority of which did not have any
such instrument in place. This ‘second generation’ of AI strategies
differs from the first wave in that they are more comprehensive and
involve ethics, regulation, and development issues in the policy
repertoire of these strategies in more explicit terms. Many countries
with an existing AI strategy are embarking on a revision of these
terms.^45^

As data plays such a pivotal role in ML models, its access and sharing
are key considerations for sectors involved in the development and
uptake of AI. In these AI strategies and related processes, countries
continue to focus on providing access to civil society and firms to
public sector data, not only open government data but also geodata and
transportation data, as well as data sharing within the public sector.
It is becoming increasingly evident that national strategies are
focusing on open data access policies and strategies not only for the
original purposes of transparency, research, and innovation, but also
more forcefully to promote the development of AI systems in those
contexts.^46^ Examples mapped by the OECD range from provision of access
to weather, climate, and marine data following the example of the Danish
Meteorological Institute; European co-operation on space data; the
production of public data available in an open, reusable, and accessible
format for ML in several countries across different regions
(consolidated and emerging economies); the creation of several national
AI policies plan to develop centralized, accessible repositories of open
public data; and the creation of special agencies and institutions
devoted to data, as is the case of national data institutes or similar
organizations. The OECD AI observatory mapped 70 initiatives contained
in different AI strategies and plans concerning data access and sharing
as part of the policies defined as ‘AI enablers’.

At the same time, countries and regional institutions such as the EU and
Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) seek to
incentivize and discuss data sharing in the private sector for AI
systems development. For firms, there are some incentives connected with
their data sharing for AI systems development, the consolidation of
institutional network and ecosystems, open innovation purposes, and
public ‘good’ research purposes. At the same time, firms lead ‘data/AI
for good initiatives’ as part of the repertoire of instruments that are
developed in partnership with other local actors (governments,
universities, and civil society) mostly attending climate change and
environment issues, followed by AI to achieve the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) and healthcare as the three main sectors in
different national contexts.^47^

Two recent events have spurred the debates concerning data access for
science and AI: the COVID-19 pandemic and the widespread emergence of
generative AI applications for the larger public, with commercial
applications such as ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Gemini. In the first case,
AI systems proved to be instrumental in some areas, such as vaccine
development.^48^ However, despite the many diagnostic and predictive
tools, most of them were flawed for various reasons.^49^ These
weaknesses concerned data that was of poor quality, not standardized,
mislabeled, biased, and frequently from unknown sources. Another issue
identified in the UNESCO report^50^ was ‘that frequently neither data
nor training models were shared since academic researchers have commonly
few career incentives to do so’. The gap in terms of access to vaccines
and relevant treatments that could be developed with AI based on large
volumes of data exposed the need to include scientists from less
favoured environments. A similar perception of asymmetry in power and
capacity concerned generative AI systems that have flooded the digital
public sphere since the emergence of ChatGPT by the American firm OpenAI
in November 2022. These Generative foundation models (GFMs) rely on vast
quantities of data. The costs of processing such huge amounts of data to
develop these systems and train these models would make it impossible
for research ventures in middle- and low-income countries, as well as
small and medium enterprises (SMEs), to compete.

## Polycentric Governance Theories and Digital Data

The digital network environment is a contentious socio-technical
infrastructure due to its increasing power asymmetries, open-ended
characteristics, and commons spaces that are exploited by different
types of private and state actors, which foster strong disciplinary and
policy debates about global governance. Polycentric theories are
relevant in governance studies due to their ability to provide insights
and frameworks for understanding and analyzing the complexities of
governance. This chapter expands on the theorizing of polycentric
governance of digital data as one that provides a set of lenses that
help tie together the wide range of actors, issues, and processes that
are involved in access to digital data for research as a specific and
contentious issue concerning digital data governance more broadly.^51^
Polycentrism reveals multiple power centres and connections, including
formal and informal arrangements, multiple scales (local-to-global), and
different sectors (governmental, commercial, civil society, technical,
academic).^52^ The polycentric condition involves both dispersion and
structure.^53^ Polycentrism sheds light on both formal and informal
attempts to address concerns surrounding data at different levels of
activity and across sectors. It enables the identification and
assessment of highly fluid arrangements emerging in global digital data
governance.

Even in the specific domain of data governance concerning access to data
for research, there are tensions, contradictions, and normative
expectations which need to come to conversation. Polycentric
perspectives help draw together a growing range of insights from
different disciplines about digital data governance: how it occurs, how
it might occur differently, and how it should occur. It also allows to
pinpoint specific sources of tensions, rule formation, and mechanisms.
Adopting polycentric perspectives help identify and connect key actors
and location of authority across different levels – national, regional,
international – in making sense of the complexities of global digital
data governance and how to rebalance and question them from the point of
view of the needs of researchers more widely.

Most significantly, polycentricity addresses the sources of authority
and decision-making centres that are involved in the different data
governance issues. Particularly in the case of common goods – that is,
those that are more prone to excluding others from their consumption,
misuse, and/or depletion – polycentricity allows to trace both micro and
macro practices of power and different types of formal and informal
authority that shape both data and its governance at a macro level.
While data may not be fully considered a pure common good, the tensions
surrounding its governance lie in the lowering of barriers to its access
that has been part of a process of expansion of digitalization,
datafication, and radical productive transformation.^54^ The corporate
sector, mainly the platformbased technological companies, have managed
to capture the largest amounts of data globally.^55^

Up until a decade ago, polycentric governance theory was mainly related
with the institutional perspectives from the Bloomington School and
Elinor and Vincent Ostrom’s work on common-pool resources, which have
influenced the studies concerning digital data governance from a data
commons approach and related institutional and normative practices,
including data trusts and ‘data sovereignty’.^56^ With an international
and complexity lens on polycentric governance, a more explicit focus
emerges on the dynamics of power, legitimacy, authority, cooperation, as
well as more day-to-day dispersed forms of technical coordination by
firms, citizens, civil society, and other actors.

Both data in its digital form and governance are open and contested
notions. There is not one single approach to or understanding of what
digital data governance is, either conceptually or from a policy
perspective. How data is governed in the digital space is a polycentric
issue. Some forms of data have achieved regulatory governance status, as
is the case of data protection or data pertaining to intellectual
property, though other functionalities of data, particularly those that
concern research and innovation, are involved in more fluid notions
where the dispersion of interests, actors, and regulatory possibilities
at the national and international levels are much more debatable.
Regulatory polycentric regimes^57^ are defined similarly to how recent
theoretical developments have expanded on polycentric theorizing to
address transnational issues.^58^ A crucial difference is that
regulatory polycentric regimes as approached by Julia Black are
developed as a set of sustained events to modify the behaviour of
others,^59^ while polycentric theorizing on digital data governance
specifically^60^ is at an earlier stage in the construction of a
normativity for a regime, probably because of the need for further
analysis on existence, overlap, and tensions of multiple regimes that
operate on the spectrum of digital data. Polycentric governance involves
different actor constellations operating with multiple rationalities,
normative orientations, ethical concerns, technologies, and
institutional arrangements. Digital data from this perspective is
subject to different modes of knowledge, uses, and interpretations, both
from a scholarly and policy perspective.

## Polycentricity, OS and AI Strategies

In this section, the OS paradigm and the national AI strategies are
discussed with a polycentric governance lens to assess their relevance
for data access for research. Both policy approaches are examined
against the characterization of specific sites of power as those that
have the capacity to change other actors’ behaviours, and those of
authority as those that have influence on others based on some
legitimacy claims, rooted in the Weberian distinction that is critical
for polycentric governance theories from the Ostrom legacy to newer
approaches.^61^ This classification is relevant for this work as the
policies that are examined – OS and AI strategies – are not binding laws
and must navigate different levels, actors, ambiguous hierarchies, and
diffused authorities, all of which are typical attributes of polycentric
governance^62^ which needs some form of legitimacy as a minimum baseline
from which to influence behaviours, norms, and expectations.

Against a polycentric governance framework, these disparate arrangements
are examined by connecting three different systemic organizing forces
that frame the issue of access to data for research purposes from a
polycentric governance lens. These systemic ordering forces are *norms*,
*practices*, and *underlying orders*. They allow to move beyond an
ontological characterization of data governance through a lens of
polycentric attributes to one where the relations between these three
forces and their interconnections are rendered. Norms may be defined as
principles that inform the process of governing, and they guide ideas
and behaviours on what is correct.^63^ As a specific analytical point of
entry, normative approaches take into account both ethical orientations
and legal foundations. Practices are what people do with varying degrees
of consciousness in their everyday routines and the regulating effects
of these actions on how ‘things are done’.^64^ Finally, ‘underlying
orders’ are the most invisible and deeply embedded systemic forces that
ultimately shape many of the conscious adoption of norms and unconscious
practices in a polycentric arrangement. Underlying orders are systemic
in that they permeate different connections in a polycentric governance
regime.^65^ They are powerful driving forces for practices and norms.

Table 2.1 summarizes the findings in the respective approaches with a
polycentric framework. Both OS and AI strategies configure specific data
interests and are nuanced particularly in what concerns the practices
and the underlying orders. The increasing overlap of sites of power and
authority in these two domains configures a cross-policy polycentric
governance sector of digital data access.

### Open Science

In terms of sites of governance and authority in OS, since 2021 the
UNESCO framework has generated an international and quasi-global
instrument that represents a global site of authority for its
governance. Yet the OS movement faces strong challenges concerning the
application of FAIR principles, ‘particularly in the Global South, as
countries need to transform the normative incentives within government
bodies and funding agencies, as well as the evaluation models for
researchers, institutions, and research programs’.^66^ OS and data
governance approaches in many of these countries need not only to update
existing practices but also to change long-standing approaches on how
data is conceptualized, including intellectual property issues. On the
other hand, the application of FAIR principles to data becomes one of
the most consistent practices to guarantee the implementation of OS and
is also unequivocally polycentric as claimed by their authors: ‘The
resulting data ecosystem, therefore, appears to be moving away from
centralization, is becoming more diverse, and less integrated, thereby
exacerbating the discovery and re-usability problem for both human and
computational stakeholders.’^67^ While there are inherent tensions that
aim to centralize data for historical reasons motivated by intellectual
property concerns and even security, greater demands placed on
transparency and democratization principles invoke a different
perception of the problem.

The multiplicity of policies concerning OS indicates the need for a
suitable platform for its implementation in the scientific community; on
the other hand, the diversity of these supportive policies reveals the
wide range of subjects and the array of the OS ecosystem. Therefore, the
distinctive features of the scientific community of the country in
question should be considered. Realizing such a systemic change involves
an internationally coordinated effort of researchers, universities,
research institutes, publishers, research councils, and
policymakers.^68^

Ghislaine Chartron spelled out three different and convergent orders of
values and beliefs that underly the OS paradigm: ‘the *ethical values*
of science as defined by Merton (1942 \[1973\]), *data science* as a new
scientific paradigm, and *innovation* as a source of economic
growth’.^69^ According to this vision, the innovation system is at the
heart of the promotion of OS. Knowledge production must cross-fertilize
scientific fields, companies, and governments.^70^ Possible transfers
between science, the economic fabric, and civil society to gain growth
and confidence in science become the basic motivation. ‘When these three
regimes come face to face, a certain confusion gradually sets in. Hardly
reconcilable visions are being projected, such as the defense of the
common good of science and the quest to create value for the
socio-economic world.’^71^ These visions underscore the inherent
tensions in a polycentric domain with different underlying orders.

Moradi and Abdi’s research focused on European OS policies found that
these prioritized open access publications, followed by open research
data.^72^ Their work also noted the conflation of the notion of open
access to data included in publications, rather than data for research.
Part of the normative underpinnings of access to data by the OS movement
concerns different framings around intellectual property provisions and
privacy regulations when personal data is involved, but most relevantly
the incentives for researchers to generate open data repositories. While
Latin America aims to increase uptake and foster open access indexed
journal repositories, the application of the FAIR principles to data has
not yet been substantively accomplished.^73^

### AI Strategies and Plans

AI strategies tend to approach data governance as a vital resource for
local AI development.^74^ The creation of large datasets is essential
for the development of AI, sector-specific innovation, and capacity
creation. Local research communities have been shown to be key actors in
many contexts in the formulation of these policy instruments, but their
concerns were not met in the first generation of AI strategies in most
countries.

AI plans that formulate access to data for research have a strong
competitive incentive. Practically all strategies address access to data
for research with a utilitarian and geopolitical understanding,
concerning the ‘AI race’ where indicators about number of standards,
conference papers, and the like are routinely compared.^75^ There are
few interdisciplinary approaches or concerns in AI strategies for
non-computer approaches to data and AI. Access to data for research is
not even considered as part of the repertoire of many AI strategies, and
these interests are included in other policy instruments, notably in the
science sector.^76^ In a recent regional AI index covering 12 countries
in Latin America,^77^ access to relevant data is confined to the
dimensions of the Global Data Barometer which are more relevant for an
open government strategy rather than for comprehensive national data
strategies that are needed in AI and OS.

The sites for power and authority for AI plans have been developed by
different organizational bodies, steered mostly by national and regional
governments and supranational organizations such as the OECD and UNESCO.
The OECD published in 2019 its document on principles on AI, which was
endorsed by other countries outside of this organization. The document
maps the development of, and access to, a digital ecosystem for
trustworthy AI that includes digital technologies and infrastructure
‘and mechanisms for sharing AI knowledge, as appropriate. In this
regard, governments should consider promoting mechanisms, such as data
trusts, to support the safe, fair, legal, and ethical sharing of
data’.^78^ Karen Yeung assesses the OECD recommendation as treading
between two underlying forces with normative approaches: the ethical
imperative to provide safeguards to the rise of AI risks but also as
enablers ‘to avoid killing the golden goose of technological
innovation’.^79^

The UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI has spurred a more
specific normative orientation on the ethics of AI as the centrepiece of
this recommendation. It has become the only document with a global reach
and though it is not legally binding, it is an authoritative instrument.
UNESCO is pursuing this authoritativeness by implementing a readiness
assessment methodology (RAM) instrument, which in 2023 spanned over 50
countries, many of which already had national AI plans in place but were
looking to further enhance the ethical dimensions and the ensuing
policies that should be implemented. The increasing regulatory and
legislative measures related with AI development, as is the case of the
AI Act of 2024 in the EU as well as the UNESCO initiative on the RAM,
are promoting a normative orientation towards AI systems that fully
incorporates binding legal measures.

From an underlying orders perspective, utilitarian perspectives
predominate in AI strategies as their socio-technical imaginaries^80^
are imbued by notions of supremacy in AI capacity, the AI race, and
cybernetic futures.^81^ Utilitarian approaches look at the maximization
of benefits for ‘a majority’, which have greater difficulty in matching
these expectations on the consequences and outcomes of data-driven AI
systems at broader social levels. The solutionist approach of national
and regional AI strategies is another fundamental underlying order that
is aligned with utilitarian values. ‘Solutionist beliefs are a
particularly important part of the spirit of digital capitalism, which
we define as those normative beliefs that play a legitimizing,
motivating and orienting role for today’s tech companies.’^82^ These
beliefs are present in AI strategies and inform not only how tech and AI
firms see themselves but also how they are perceived by others, notably
governments which steer the developments of these national plans. While
there is an increasing normative orientation on the inclusion of
societal risks and the ethical and human rights principles that should
be the foundations of AI plans, their underlying orders are still at
odds as the geopolitics of AI is still predominant.

## Conclusion

The aim of the chapter has been to develop a case for a more holistic
and relational approach to the issue of access to data for research
purposes, beyond existing possibilities as those portrayed in the
DMA–DSA package, by discussing different data regimes found in many
contexts, including global majority regions, with a polycentric theory.
This chapter adopted a normative orientation concerning the relevance of
access to data for research purposes and developed a case to address
this by encompassing two existing policies – OS and AI strategies – as
policy alternatives to further advance other scientific interests and
uses from a polycentric perspective. This normative stance was adopted
as an intellectual response to the increasing centrality of data-driven
AI technologies and large platforms power vis-à-vis local research
capacity.

A polycentric lens enabled the connection of different sites of power
and authority, as well as different normative, practical, and underlying
orders of these arrangements. The different policy and regulatory
initiatives involving access to digital data are a manifestation of
broader theoretical, political, and sociotechnical intersections.^83^
Currently, available policy initiatives should address these different
centres of power and authority from these specialized fields and build
bridges as access claims are shared. This recommendation is not
concerned with promoting centralization, that is, hierarchically
concentrating power and authority for the different implications
concerning digital data and access for research, but rather about
developing pathways across these different policy domains, increasing
coordination and coherence. This is particularly relevant for many
countries in global majority contexts that have consolidated their own
trajectories in some domains – for example, in Latin America with
national open data strategies and open science initiatives and in Asia
with consolidated national AI strategies – but whose regulations will be
difficult to implement as those like the DMA–DSA in Europe. The
involvement of the global, regional, and national levels in the analysis
is the key to understanding how access to data for research is framed
and how it should evolve.

Since 2021, there is a more pronounced global configuration around OS
and AI strategies led by UNESCO with its two recommendations approved in
that same year. These global policy instruments are not only relevant as
additional sites of international governance but also more particularly
since they provide common ground to conversations that would otherwise
be disconnected. This international expansion also spurs the involvement
of middle- and lower-income countries. Without a global and mobilized
research community, specific instruments such Article 40 of the DSA that
is devised for a particular region would not have so much power and
authority across other national governance sites.

Policymaking at a national level is essential for the development of
data access policies for research. Like other policy innovations, it
will require adjustments and redefinitions of governance structures,
including reviewing or formulating policies that are critical drivers
for implementations in the OS domain, in the AI policies space, and in
the complementary strategies that should be considered to address a
polycentric issue.^84^ Some of these policies will become legally coded,
but others will be addressed through practices, as has been the case of
the expansion of the FAIR and CARE principles for data and the open
repository initiatives that rely on organic processes and different
timings.

Polycentric governance theorizing proved to be a relevant lens to frame
the different sites of power and authority that are embedded in OS and
AI policy initiatives and their connections with other initiatives to
reframe the current landscape of data control around large platforms. It
helps to develop a position around difference and negotiation, rather
than centralization of power as the only alternative solution to either
Big Tech predominance or governmental control. Polycentricity also
embraces the institutional complexity concerning digital data
governance, including the political economy of digital data commons, in
an era of mass web scraping to train fundamental AI models, which is one
of the major contentions in the contemporary debates about the systemic
power of large corporations with implications for data protection and
intellectual property concerns.

Two substantive differences between OS and AI national plans stand out
in the redefinition of data governance rules. The first is concerned
with the conditions for research and how scientists make their own data
available, structural access, and the publishing of data. OS and
principles such as FAIR and CARE reconfigure the norms and underlying
structures of research and data. It has a meta-governance configuration
where the norms and practices are subverted to incorporate new
conditions ‘about’ research and access to data. This has implications
for the wider ecosystem and governance sites. AI strategies, on the
other hand, are more inclined to develop a tactical approach towards
data concerned with conditions ‘for’ research. The provocation is
extended to rethink beyond a framing of OS in relation to science
policy^85^ and to develop a triangular dialogue between OS, science
policy, and AI policy to advance access to data for research, among
other objectives. This is a vital link where the research community
should play an active role in the reconfiguration of norms, practices,
and underlying orders about contemporary notions around digital data and
knowledge.

Future work could engage more thoroughly on issues concerning ‘data
access’ for research from a justice and sustainability lens. The
problems concerning access are relevant as they not only encompass a
range of dimensions, including data infrastructures, some of which
already have polycentric attributions, and their availability, but also
capabilities and skills of local communities and epistemic power. The
reification of data and datafication processes should also be examined
against more thorough philosophical positions concerning the
construction of legitimacy of certain types of knowledge, as the
introduction to this volume by Jef Ausloos and Siddharth Peter de Souza
has highlighted.^86^ Further studies could also address the different
disciplinary stakes on the issue of access to data for research,
including a global majority perspective that situates practices of
science and innovation policies.

## Appendix 2A

The following public forums and events informed this research through a
modality of participant observation: (*a*) 4 May 2023: virtual
discussion organized by UNESCO on the readiness assessment methodology
(RAM) published by this organization;^87^ (*b*) 10–11 May 2023: workshop
convened by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) (Buenos Aires) as
part of a consultation on AI and its impact on democracy and human
rights; and (*c*) 28–30 June 2023: roundtables organized by the Agency
for Electronic Government and Information and Knowledge Society
(AGESIC), the national agency for digital government of Uruguay, as part
of the revision of the national AI strategy. These spaces were nurtured
by the presence of policymakers, experts, and advocates from Argentina,
Brazil, Egypt, and Uruguay and organizations such as UNESCO and the
Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean (CAF), and civil
society participants from Canada, Poland, the United States, and various
countries in Latin America.
