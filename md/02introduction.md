# The Many Faces of Data Access
## Legal and Policy implications for research

The Many Faces of Data Access: Legal and Policy implications for
research provides a rich and interdisciplinary critique of regulation
and, in the process, opens the ‘black box’ of technology companies to
researchers. It brings together scholars from across the globe, working
in varied fields including critical legal studies, science and
technology studies, critical data studies, and digital humanities. The
book explores questions of data access – to acquire and use data
meaningfully as well as resist power. It covers a variety of themes,
including the opportunities and challenges of the law as a tool for
observing digital infrastructures, the political economy of data access
for research, and the power dynamics between academia, private/public
sector, and civil society. In doing so, the book also examines these
questions in terms of the politics of knowledge production and
investigates whether there is a privileging of geographical and
institutional contexts in data access regimes.
