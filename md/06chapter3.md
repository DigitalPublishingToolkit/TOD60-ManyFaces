**Violent Plains**

Challenges and Strategies for Pastoralists’

Data Access in Ghana[^06chapter3_1]

*Frank Kwaku Agyei, Lawrence Kwabena Brobbey, Paul Osei-Tutu, and
Boateng Kyereh*

The conflict between pastoralists (cattle farmers) and crop farmers
constitutes a major source of natural resource conflict in Africa. It
was initially thought that the declining availability of grass and water
resources and the complex land tenure system in Africa drive the
conflict.^1^ The depletion of grasslands – to feed cattle – results in
competition between farmers and cattle herders for control over grass
and farmlands, and that results in intense clashes and violent
confrontations.^2^ Several instances of the conflict have been reported
to show its growing intensity, geographic scope, and effects of
displacements, losses, and deaths.^3^ Subsequent works in the humanities
and social sciences have suggested that the violent clashes between
farmers and herders are a result of differences in their ethnic and
identity backgrounds – typical in Nigeria where the conflict occurs
between Muslim or Fulani herders and Christian farmers.^4^ More recent
studies suggest political marginalization through land use politics
favouring crop farming over pastoralism creates power imbalances and
sustains tensions between farmers and herders to increase the prevalence
of the conflict.^5\ ^

In Ghana, the conflict has gained considerable media attention and
engendered continuing public debate. Despite ongoing efforts by the
Ghana government to address the conflict, there are widespread claims of
forced population displacements, losses, and destructive reactions. In
2016, youth in southern Ghana killed 80 cattle belonging to Fulani
herdsmen when the cattle invaded their farms, and two farmers were shot
dead in their farms by Fulani herdsmen in Agogo. Between 2009 and 2012,
a total of 12 people were killed in Agogo town.^6^ In Berekum (southern
Ghana), hundreds of armed residents attacked and evicted herdsmen from
their homes, which resulted in the death of 13 herdsmen and 4
farmers.^7^ In northern Ghana, a series of fights between Konkomba
farmers and nomadic herders resulted in over 562 families becoming
homeless as well as loss of livestock, money, and other properties.^8^
The trauma and psychological effects of experiences with conflicts
hinder farmers and herders from rebuilding their lives and livelihoods
as the skirmish weakens the social capital of communities, and these
experiences negatively impact the roles that men and women play in
societies.

The media is often criticized for being biased towards pastoralists in
the framing of the conflict in news reportages, leading to their
stigmatization. Journalists covering the majority of Fulani
pastoralists’ stories rely on secondary accounts and rumoured data. Most
journalists are not eyewitnesses to the issues they raise, and there is
homogenization of Fulani ethnic groups with herdsmen when individual
herdsmen are being referred to.^9^ Often, pastoralists are portrayed as
‘foreigners’ and ‘treacherous’ by news media outlets, and that has
contributed to an unfriendly and unfair discussion against herders and
perpetuated an unfavourable opinion of them in Ghanaian society.^10^
Through the use of the language of alienation and frames that
stigmatize, herders are put at the margins of Ghanaian society.
Pastoralist communities are being marginalized, and this has resulted in
their passiveness and poor participation in social interventions,
particularly programmes that seek access to their data. This undermines
possibilities for generating holistic, secure, and scalable data
critical to rebuilding pastoralist heritage and dignity among
pastoralists and farmers.

Much scholarly attention has been devoted to structural explanations of
farmer–herder conflicts, pastoralism and rural economies, political
economy associated with pastoralism, and institutional interference. The
evidence indicates that transhumance and nomadic herders are the main
culprits of the conflict. They live in camps in bushy areas and engage
in grazing of cattle at night. Further, studies suggest that many
herdsmen and their families speak Fulbe and/or other non-Ghanaian
languages,^11^ and hence poorly integrate with local Ghanaian
households. The need to integrate perspectives of nomadic and
transhumance herders in conflict management initiatives is widely
recognized. Yet pastoralism literature has not systematically accounted
for the challenges associated with getting access to pastoralists’ data.
Data access denotes having access rights in a legal or political sense
as well as activities relating to collecting, storing, and acting on
data housed in a database.^12^ Understanding the challenges as well as
the strategies and opportunities associated with pastoralism-related
data access is an important starting point for improving the well-being
and peace among farmers and herders in Ghana and beyond. In this
chapter, we examine (*a*) challenges associated with pastoralists’ data
access, (*b*) strategies employed by researchers and development actors
to get access to pastoralists’ data, and (*c*) opportunities for
pastoralists’ data access. The next section outlines the methods used
for data collection and analysis. This is followed by sections on the
results and discussion.

# Methods

The study targeted six categories of people for data collection:
researchers (universities), non-governmental organizations (NGOs),
cattle owners, herdsmen, government, and other key informants in the
cattle industry (Table 3.1). The researchers look into pastoralism and
are based at four public universities in Ghana: Kwame Nkrumah University
of Science and Technology, Kumasi; University of Energy and Natural
Resources, Sunyani; University for Development **Table 3.1** Category
and sample of respondents used for the study

*Note*: \*We relied on social networks existing among pastoralists to
gain access to them. The herdsmen who were first approached connected us
to other herders in their network.

Studies, Tamale; and University of Cape Coast. The NGOs – Changing Lives
in Innovative Partnerships (CLIP) and Rescue Mission International –
engage in community empowerment and climate-resilient strategies of
which pastoralist work is a main thematic focus. ‘Pastoralist’ generally
refers to a cattle and other livestock farmer, but in this chapter it
specifically denotes a cattle farmer. ‘Herdsman’ and ‘herder’ are used
interchangeably to mean a person looking after a cattle herd.
Pastoralism literature identifies three distinct categories of herders
in Ghana: settled, nomadic, and transhumance.^13^ The settled herders
live among the indigenous agricultural population while the nomadic
herders live in mobile camps located in isolated bush areas. The
transhumance herders are also nomadic but engage in regular and seasonal
movement.^14^ Efforts were made to obtain settled, nomadic, and
transhumance respondents when sampling the herdsmen. The sampled
herdsmen raised cattle in Agogo in the Asante Akim North district and in
Sekyere Afram Plains (Ashanti Region) and Kwahu Afram Plains (Eastern
Region). We relied on social networks and pastoralist relations,
including ethnic and religious leaders, to gain permission and access to
herdsmen and cattle owners. Data collection occurred over five months
between 2022 and 2023 in English and the Twi language (a common dialect
in Ghana) using interview guides. The interview guides collected data by
asking questions such as follows: What is the nature of challenges
associated with pastoralism research and data access? What arrangements
and practices do you employ to obtain access to pastoralist data and
why? How does the cultivation of relations and social networks enable
access to pastoralist data? What opportunities exist for pastoralist
data access? The empirical work was complemented with desk-based
research, including a review of policy and legal documents.

Responses obtained from all categories of respondents were analysed
together following content analysis. When analysing responses to ‘how’
and ‘why’ questions, it located the reasoning underlying respondents’
replies. When asked the question ‘How (by what means) do you gain access
to transhumant herders for data collection, and why do you employ
particular approach(es)?’ the underlying reasons given to support the
preferred approach(s) were sought from the responses to the
aforementioned questions. A list of underlying reason(s) was generated
for each respondent after systematically reading the answers of all the
respondents. The next stage of the analysis looked for common patterns
in the underlying reasons provided by respondents and clustered them
according to common reasons such as social relations of friendship. The
findings have been presented in themes and relevant quotes have been
used to support explanations.

# Results 

We present findings for the study structured under four themes: (*a*)
pastoralists’ environment, (*b*) challenges associated with
pastoralists’ data access, (*c*) strategies enabling access to
pastoralists’ data, and (*d*) opportunities to access pastoralists’
data.

## Pastoralists’ Environment

The pastoralists engaged in the study narrated their work environment to
constitute a dynamic and extreme terrain. Generally, the settled herders
live among local farming communities and send cattle to grazeable areas
on fallow lands and in village surroundings, but return to villages
after feeding the animals. The transhumance and nomadic herders live in
camps in distant places in the bush. Nomadic herders are in touch with
farming communities, have social exchanges through selling of cow milk
and meat with villages, and are more likely to settle in local
communities. One transhumance herder explained the rationale for
spending the most time in the bush to be that ‘the cattle eat a lot, and
they need to walk often to avoid contamination and spread of diseases
and pests. We will not get adequate feed for our animals if we stay in
one place; but in the forest, the animals can feed for a long time’
(Herdsman 5, 10 January 2023). A cattle owner added that ‘the cattle
need much land and forage and water; places with much of those are good
for the livestock, but areas with more trees are not good’ (Cattle Owner
1, 10 December 2022).

Yet life in the bush is fraught with several challenges, ranging from
extreme weather conditions (scorching sun and excessive rainfall) to
security and health issues. It was narrated that ‘in the bush, the rain
falls on me several times when I am out to feed the cattle, and I
confront wild animals on regular occasions’ (Herdsman 5, 10 January
2023). Most herdsmen in the study share the experience of losing cattle
to wild animals, and several others have experienced robbery attacks in
the bush. Herders explained that the possibilities of being confronted
with dangerous wild animals as they move in the forest encourage them to
move along with sophisticated weapons such as guns. Those who keep no
weapons move in groups, usually with family members. A herder observed,
‘We sometimes get lost in the bush, but when we roam for a long time, we
can locate where we are’ (Herdsman 1, 5 February 2023). More recently,
struggles over access to land have emerged to blur pastoralist–farmer
relations. In the past, farmers and herders peacefully coexisted because
land was readily available to accommodate small herder populations.
Farmers and herders lived apart from each other, so there was minimal
interaction between them. Currently, land is largely competed for due to
the need for new lands for farming and the rising herd population which
demands large pasture lands. A herdsman revealed that ‘now we see farms
everywhere even in places where there were no farms … the farms have now
increased in sizes’ (Herdsman 8, 4 February 2023). Herdsmen attribute
land struggles to its commodification in rural communities.

## Challenges Associated with Pastoralists’ Data Access

This section outlines challenges constraining access to reliable
pastoralist-related data. Pastoralists’ data access is challenged by
inaccessible locations; health and security concerns; language barrier;
non-participatory and biased behaviour; and disorderly, unclean,
subjective, and undocumented data.

The distant places where herdsmen keep cattle render their access by
researchers a challenge. Being an agrarian country, the majority of
rural Ghanaians engage in crop farming as their main livelihood
activity. Relatively, few village people add cattle production as their
main or alternative livelihood, though city men employ the labour of
Fulani herders to look after their cattle. The nature of cattle
production where regular feed is needed demands that herdsmen live near
savannah areas where there is readily available feed for cattle. Most
herdsmen echo that they ‘keep cattle at a distance and away from arable
farmers due to the nature of the work which demands caring for cattle
close to the bush so we can easily feed the cattle and prevent damage to
crops’ (Herdsman 1, 16 February 2023). Transhumance and nomadic herders
are normally located at places several kilometres away from villages.
Accessing transhumance herders requires hours of travel, usually by
motorcycles. Herdsmen hardly keep cattle at a particular location;
rather, they are always on the move due to daily struggles to secure
adequate feed and water for their livestock. This is the case for both
nomadic herders who roam frequently on a particular terrain as well as
transhumance herders who migrate on a seasonal basis. One researcher
echoed that ‘living in the bushes is their \[herdsmen’s\] cultural
trait’ (Researcher 2, 10 January 2023).

Lack of footpath and road networks limit possibilities in accessing
herder locations in the field. Agricultural lands used for crop farming
have footpaths used by farm owners. Footpaths are generally created and
maintained by families and individual farmers who use them regularly.
Grazing lands do not have footpaths since cattle do not move along
cleared paths in the field, but herders can follow animals as they move
through bushes. Herdsmen are good at adapting to movement in bushes, but
non-herders tend to struggle when walking in bushy areas. Further, the
environment where herders keep cattle is dry and hot, and prone to
myriad physical and emotional challenges such as wildlife attacks. Such
extreme environments are not favourable destinations for most
non-herders and deter many researchers from contacting herders in the
field.

Further, herdsmen do not want people to know their locations and
movements in the field for security reasons. It is common for herdsmen
to be silent about the places in the field where they keep their cattle
and about their movement routes. They do so to maintain the safety of
the cattle and of themselves since police services are not present in
the secluded places where nomadic and transhumance herders normally keep
their cattle. Transhumant and nomadic herders are exposed to various
security risks, including human attacks due to poor identification and
invasion by thieves. Some herdsmen observed that farmers put false
claims on them for atrocities they have not committed: ‘In the bush, we
\[herdsmen\] face several challenges … Sometimes we meet armed robbers
and we have to fight back; and at times we go to some villages, and when
the farmers are not able to identify particular cattle destroying their
crops, they blame us’ (Herdsman 5, 10 January 2023). Generally,
researchers noted that ‘sometimes herders are unable to describe their
locations in the field because they find it difficult to describe the
places since they do not stay in one place, but others also do not want
people to know where they keep the cattle’ (Researcher 1, 20 January
2023).

Pastoralists’ non-participatory behaviour limits the extent to which
researchers obtain data from them. Cattle herders are reluctant to speak
to researchers, particularly to those who do not seek permission from
their leaders, and this makes data collection a challenge. The herdsmen
demand researchers and development actors to directly contact the owners
of the cattle they are taking care of. Herders posit that the owners
make absolute decisions on their cattle and that their leaders are also
more capable of delving into conflicts since they often attend
skirmish-related meetings and have access to relevant information to
enable them to make well-informed contributions. Other pastoralists
share the concern that lands they have legally obtained from chiefs and
landowners and have occupied for centuries are often contested by
individual farmers. One herder narrated, ‘My father paid for the land we
feed our cattle on; he paid the big chief and there are documents on
that, but you can see how farmers have approached the land’ (Herdsman 3,
10 January 2023).

The nomadic and transhumance herders have limited social contact with
local villages, and that delays their ability to learn Ghanaian
languages. The majority of pastoralists in Ghana, particularly herders,
are of foreign origin who have migrated from the Sahel region and speak
the Fulbe language and/or other Sahel languages. Some herders settle in
farming villages, and others maintain nomadic status by moving across
different places to feed cattle. Settled herders are better placed to
socially integrate with people in the societies they live in and where
they learn local languages. On the other hand, most transhumance and
nomadic herders due to their movement do not easily integrate socially
with local Ghanaian societies; rather, they live with their families in
isolated camps. Occasionally, nomadic and transhumance herders move to
cities to sell cow milk and purchase food items and then return to their
original locations.

Pastoralists’ data are subjective and skewed, and that limits the
possibility of accessing it accurately. Different herder types –
nomadic, transhumance, and settled – share different stories about the
conflict. The field experiences revealed that the accounts of several
farmers and pastoralists were mere word of mouth of family members and
people living in their neighbourhoods. In instances where farmers and
pastoralists were asked to relate to specific and personal stories, most
of them could not since the experiences reported on related to other
members of their communities. There were instances where figures quoted
as the cost of damages to crops, animals, and other kinds of property
were largely exaggerated. The standard of accuracy of data presented by
cattle actors is dependent on the lens (objective and subjective) that
actors involved in conflicts employ to view their situations. Objective
accuracy is rooted in prediction and is based on domains of knowledge.
There are instances where conflict actors employ objective means – for
instance, through the documented conflict cases at the local government
and police services offices – to predict the outcomes of conflicts.
Subjective accuracy, on the other hand, is rooted in imagination and is
based on intuition.^15^ The use of a subjective accuracy lens in
imagining what is going to happen in a conflict environment dominates in
the case we investigate. Perhaps it is practically impossible to
separate prediction and imagination in the farmer–herder conflict; yet
to achieve peak accuracy and effectiveness requires that both channels
are in sync. Intelligent predictions are critical to making creative
decisions since accurate observations are a prerequisite for deciding
what happens next.

The violent nature of the farmer–herder conflict has caused many victims
to be displaced and resulted in the loss of lives and properties. The
negative experiences people have cause them to attach deep emotions to
conflict narrations. Conflict victims are unable to segregate their
emotions from the actual experiences they share. The attachment of
emotions to information transfer blurs access to objective data.

The police services and the district assemblies (local government) are
the main state institutions receiving complaints about the
farmer–pastoralist conflicts. Yet these actors do not have separate data
sheets for such conflicts. All cases reported to the institutions are
documented in a consolidated sheet, which needs to be segregated to
tease out pastoralist-related cases. The difficulty in segregating data
makes state institutions reluctant to provide information to
researchers. The disorderly institutional database makes the segregation
of conflict data from other data reported at public institutions a
challenge.

## Strategies Enabling Access to Pastoralists’ Data 

This section outlines the strategies researchers and development actors
use to enable access to pastoralists’ data. A broad set of social
relations, including social identity and membership in groupings by
ethnicity and religion, negotiation of social relations to authority and
relations of friendship and trust, and access to geographic knowledge of
pastoralists, enable access to reliable pastoralists’ data.

Access to the geographic knowledge of pastoralists is critical for
accessing pastoralists’ data. The location of transhumance and nomadic
herders are difficult to find, but researchers rely on the snowball
approach to get access to new herders. First, researchers need to know
the locations of at least one or two herders. Most researchers noted
that ‘a Fulani herder you know will lead you to another Fulani herder
because they know themselves and the environment where they keep their
livestock’ (Researcher 3, 5 February 2023). The close relations of
friendship and trust serve as the first contact to new herder recruits.
Usually, the focal persons who are friends with herder groups are those
whom herders are comfortable relating to.

Access through social identity and membership in a group, including
groupings by ethnicity and religion, shapes access to pastoralists’
data. One researcher narrated how being a Muslim he could easily get
access to herders for his study. Another researcher observed that ‘when
not one of their own, they do not want to talk. The herders are unable
to differentiate people who visit them so one needs to inform them where
they are coming from and which institution they belong to’ (Researcher
7, 15 January 2023). Several settled herders live in communities where
the dominant religion is Islam and most herders residing in
Muslim-dominated communities also observe the religion. Researchers with
the same religious background as herders meet and pray together and
share similar religious festivities. These shared religious meetings
enhance social bonds, causing herders to open up and share information
about their livelihood and culture.

The social relations and networks existing among herder groups,
including having access to authority and relations of friendship, also
shape access to data. When a herdsman settles in a particular community,
he makes new friends with people in the community who can either be
indigenes or persons belonging to his ethnicity; even the nomadic and
transhumance herders have close friends in villages and cities.
Pastoralists maintain close relations with their family heads and local
leaders, even with those who are physically located in distant places.
During family occasions and social and religious gatherings, most
herdsmen take advantage of meeting their close relations. Researchers
employ the contacts of family heads and local leaders to reach out to
cattle headers. One researcher explains, ‘You seek approval from cattle
owners, and you find a date and someone leads you to the bush to speak
with them \[herders\]’ (Researcher 5, 14 February 2023). For herdsmen
who are reluctant to speak, one researcher noted that ‘some were
reluctant to answer because they feel researchers have been there
several times to talk to them … I relied on key informants to lead me to
the Fulani people’ (Researcher 6, 10 January 2023). Making clan leaders
call herders to inform them of researchers’ quest to undertake studies
makes herdsmen respond positively to calls for interviews.

Getting access to labour in the form of translators who speak and
understand a herder’s native language to interpret questions and relay
responses is a means people use to get access to data. Some herdsmen,
particularly nomadic, speak several languages due to their movement
across different societies with different ethnic backgrounds. Most
herdsmen speak the Hausa language, which is spoken by a majority of
people in the West Africa region. Researchers employ the services of
local inhabitants who speak herdsmen’s language as interpreters.
However, some researchers are lucky to conduct interviews in the English
language; one such researcher observed, ‘in cases where I settled on
people who could speak my language, I talked to them’ (Researcher 7, 15
January 2023).

For farmers and pastoralists quoting extreme and ambiguous figures as
well as providing untrue narrations, researchers employ the strategies
of asking the same questions several times during interviews. They also
engage in data triangulation to assess the truthfulness of information
given by other actors participating in conflicts. Making farmers and
pastoralists show visual evidence of conflict outcomes also validates
the data provided. For example, displaced communities are asked to
provide practical evidence of pre-displaced communities. Through
observations and interactions with community members, researchers can
infer the accuracy of the information given. Community members who claim
to have sustained injuries through violent attacks are asked to show
evidence of injuries to confirm that.

There is always the tendency for victims to overstate the magnitude of
the impact of conflicts and be emotional over the issues confronting
them. Often, farmer–pastoralist conflicts make displaced people
vulnerable as they lose resources, homes, and properties. As they are
violently dispossessed of agricultural lands, communities affected by
conflicts face the destruction of their cultural heritage, embodied in
nature, and the conditions for economic and political dignity. This
undermines possibilities for sustainable peace. To stay objective
without taking sides, researchers try to be neutral by questioning the
narrations of both farmers and pastoralists in equal measure.

## Opportunities for Gaining Access to Pastoralist Data

The study identified opportunities to aid access to pastoralists’ data,
and this includes the existence of strong customary institutions and
their traditional role in mediating land access: the local government
and police services, NGOs, and pastoralist associations.

In Ghana, chieftaincy is an important cultural heritage and institution,
which has strong ethnic support and provides the structures for
leadership and exercise of authority. It denotes sacred and
sociopolitical power conferred on chiefs and priests in many parts of
Ghana.^16^ Before colonial rule in Ghana, the customary structure had
been the local political leaders acting as chiefs governing the people
and resources. In contemporary Ghana, chieftaincy has strong legal and
constitutional status. The 1992 constitution of Ghana (article 270\[1\])
indicates that ‘the institution of chieftaincy, together with its
traditional councils as established by customary law and usage, is
hereby guaranteed’. The Chieftaincy Act, 2008 (Act 759), sets the
guidelines for the functioning of chieftaincy institutions and
legitimates the National House of Chiefs to ‘undertake the progressive
study, interpretation and codification of the customary law to evolve,
in appropriate cases, a unified system of rules of customary law, and
compiling the customary laws and lines of succession applicable to each
stool or skin’. Chieftaincy is an important cultural heritage and
institution, which has strong ethnic support and creates the frameworks
for leadership and the implementation of authority. As custodians of the
land, chiefs emerge as the main institution to mediate land access in
Ghana and are very relevant for mediating pastoralist– farmer conflicts.
They have customary support to distribute land to indigenous people
under their jurisdiction and can allocate land not occupied by families
to strangers, including herdsmen who settle and work in their
territories. Due to their critical role in granting land rights to both
farmers and pastoralists, chiefs wield enormous information on
pastoralists and could play an important role in assembling
pastoralists.

The local government bodies (metropolitan, municipal, and district
assemblies) in Ghana are mandated by article 240 of the 1992
constitution of Ghana to plan and execute policies in respect to all
matters affecting the people within their areas, including issues about
pastoralist–farmer conflicts. The Police Service Act (Act 350 \[1\]) of
1970 provides police officials the mandate to ‘prevent and detect crime,
to apprehend offenders, and to maintain public order and the safety of
persons and property’. Both the district assemblies and the police
services have played active roles in the processes leading to the
mediation of pastoralist–farmer conflicts in Ghana. In Agogo in the
Asante Akim North district, the district assemblies and police services
have documented massive data on pastoralist– farmer relations which
serve as critical resources for pastoralism-related research.

NGOs mediate the pastoralist–farmer conflicts. It has also led to the
formulation of various social groups to interfere with the conflict
processes. Ghana National Federation of Livestock Inter-Professional
(GFLIP) has been doing field-based research on farmer–herder conflicts
and has enormous field contacts and experience. Universities and
academic institutions undertake research and train students on the
conflict. The Department of Silviculture and Forest Management of Kwame
Nkrumah University of Science and Technology hosts a Danish
International Development Agency (DANIDA)-funded programme dubbed
‘Access and Authority Nexus in Farmer–Herder Conflicts’ (AAN). AAN
trains PhD and MPhil students on pastoralism-related themes. The
University for Development Studies hosts the Ghana Development Studies
Hub, which provides a space where researchers and development actors
join forces to tackle pressing issues of sustainable development that
are of specific relevance to Ghana and West Africa. One key focus area
is pastoralism and other landscapebased livelihoods.

The Ghana Cattle Ranching Committee is established by the president of
Ghana with membership drawn from the ministries of food and agriculture,
national security, interior affairs, foreign affairs and regional
integration, and the Inner City and Zongo Development; universities;
GFLIP; the Ghana National Association of Cattle Farmers (GNACAF); and
the Peasant Farmers Association of Ghana (PFAG). The GNACAF has a
membership consisting of cattle owners and herders across Ghana.

# Discussion

Our results suggest that access to data from pastoralists is entangled
with challenges. The transhumance and nomadic herders keep cattle at
field locations that are distant from villages and lack marked footpaths
and road networks, rendering transhumance herders the least accessible
herder category. Data from transhumance herders are subsequently also
the least accessible and incorporated into conflict management
protocols. The health and security of cattle and herdsmen are
challenging issues in bushes. Motivated by security concerns, herdsmen
shield information on their locations and movements from the public.
Herders are reserved and display non-participatory behaviour to indicate
their reluctance to participate in development studies and programmes.
The Herdsmen’s non-engaging behaviour is a means not to open up about
cattle labour, but to exclude and delegitimize others by keeping
historically acquired knowledge to themselves. Pastoralist–farmer
conflicts are fraught with trauma and intense emotions due to the pain
and suffering resulting from the loss of lives, properties, and homes.
Hence, experiences shared in such conflicts are entwined with feelings
of closeness, affection, and subjectivity. To a large extent,
pastoralists’ data are undocumented, unclean, and disorderly kept. In
what follows, we discuss (*a*) the social, cultural, and political
contexts of pastoralists data access; (*b*) the researcher neutrality
and trustworthiness; and (*c*) the power relations and politics of
identity.

## Social, Cultural, and Political Contexts of Pastoralists’ Data Access

The findings illustrate constellations of social relationships that
enable access to pastoralists’ data. Access to geographic knowledge of
pastoralists, their network, and the ability to shape discursive terms
is a critical condition to accessing pastoralists’ data. Researchers and
development actors rely mostly on the snowball approach to recruit new
herders. Access through social identity and membership in a group,
including groupings by ethnicity and religion, shapes access to
pastoralists’ data. Muslim researchers and development actors gain
access to pastoralist groups on rights and claims attached to religious
membership. Others use ethnic background and the ability to speak the
pastoralists’ language(s) as an inclusionary strategy to obtain data.
Negotiation of social relations, such as access to authority and
relations of friendship and trust, forms a critical strategy in
accessing pastoralists’ data. This is by far the dominant mechanism
enabling access to most herdsmen. We illustrate how access to labour
opportunities via entering into a working relationship with herdsmen
grants access to pastoralists’ data. Researchers and development actors
do not labour by themselves; they rather employ the services of people
who speak the pastoralists’ native language(s).

We document opportunities to aid pastoralism-related research. Chiefs
and the customary structure are an important institution, which have
strong ethnic support and provide the structures for leadership and
exercise of authority. Being custodians of communal land, chiefs know
the boundaries of village lands and have informal networks with cattle
owners. Through the allocation of land rights, chiefs invoke authority
over farmers and pastoralists and play a critical role in mediating
conflicts between pastoralists and farmers. The local government
structure at district levels (district assemblies) wields formal powers
and serves as the central government’s representative at the local level
mandated to provide formal representation of constituents within their
jurisdiction. District assemblies, particularly in conflict-prone areas,
have extensive documented information on pastoralist–farmer conflicts
and associated issues. Other actors playing critical roles in
pastoralist–farmer conflicts include the academic and research
institutions, the Ghana Police Service, the Ghana Cattle Ranching
Committee, the GNACAF, the GFLIP, and the PFAG. Due to their long-term
engagement in pastoralist–farmer conflicts, there are potential formal
and informal networks that could be drawn upon to aid
pastoralism-related research and data access.

## Researcher Neutrality and Trustworthiness 

The findings illuminate the challenge of staying ‘neutral’ or being
‘objective’ during data collection and analysis as a researcher. The
role and identity researchers take determine to a great degree the
nature of information they will get access to, and this is more
prominent in our case where researchers have to negotiate along identity
and ethnic lines to obtain data. The positionality, trustworthiness, and
experiences from the field also play a role in the data analysis. In a
broader sense, the researcher always influences how the data is
analysed. This starts when making decisions about how to transcribe and
what parts to leave out as being not relevant to the research topic.^17^
Based on the observation that not all researchers can easily get access
to pastoral data, our analysis seems to suggest that processes of data
collection will always comprise voluntary or forced choices and will
never be able to capture the full extent of reality. Therefore, based on
the findings, this chapter argues that the real world cannot be fully
captured by data; this could lead to potential biases and problematic
outcomes if field data is relied upon excessively. While there is a need
to accept this unavoidable reality, our account demonstrates that
researchers should always be looking for new and better ways of data
collection and analysis.

## Power Relations and Politics of Identity

As discussed previously, our findings suggest the non-participatory
behaviour of pastoralists in the release of data. They do so by
directing researchers to ethnic and membership leaders as well as by
indicating an inability to understand languages used by researchers to
communicate with them. Such non-participatory behaviour reflects their
desire to exercise autonomy over data. Related ideas are shared by the
Global Indigenous Data Alliance, which advocates six rights concerning
data that indigenous people have.^18^ These are the right to
self-determination, the right to use, the right to possess, the right to
consent, the right to refuse, and the right to reclaim. Indigenous
peoples’ right to self-determination entails the ability to organize and
control data about a collective identity. In our case in Ghana, we
observe herdsmen realize that by refraining from engaging with
‘outsiders’ on an individual basis. Rather, they recognize the critical
role of ethnic and pastoralist leaders in maintaining the production of
uniform knowledge and collective identity. Our case shows how herdsmen
refuse to engage people they have no social ties with as well as the
domination of Fulani ethnicities in cattle herding; these depict the
pastoralists’ exhibition of rights to possess, refuse, and retain data
that reflect pastoralists’ identities and cultures.

Our findings also illustrate that pastoralists are reluctant to grant
data access to people they share no ethnic or membership relations with.
This suggests pastoralist groups consider themselves to be wielding
higher status over researchers and activists. It is along claims of
religious and identity backgrounds that researchers and practitioners
avoid facing discrimination in accessing data from pastoralists. We
argue that the inaccessibility of pastoralists and discrimination in the
release of data could potentially lead to biases and monopolization of
data because only a few known people will have access to important data.
The possibility of asking limited and skewed questions might lead to a
loss of valuable information that could have been gained by asking other
questions. Herders’ selective behaviour might result in the
over-representation of certain elements of a dataset and eventually lead
to low accuracy, skewed outcomes, and systemic prejudices. Putting
pastoralists’ data into domains privilege a few ethnic and religious
actors and create barriers to entry into the pastoralism landscape. This
monopoly threatens the political economy of pastoral societies and
pastoralism. The problems associated with our empirical data access
resonate with documented biases and monopolization linked to digital
data access.^19^ In Ghana, the state institutions dealing with
pastoralists’ data (district assemblies and police services) are legally
mandated to grant public access to documented data. While access to data
from public institutions could be entwined with data biases, retrieving
herdsmen’s empirical data is more likely to be subjected to systemic
biases and over-representation of data.

# Conclusion

This study has examined the challenges, strategies, and opportunities
researchers employ to gain access to pastoralism-related data. To
understand this process, the study relied on data from researchers and
NGOs engaged in pastoralism work, cattle owners, herdsmen, and other key
informants in the cattle industry. The study suggests that pastoralists
operate in a harsh social environment of solitude and are exposed to
health and psychological dangers. The adverse environment entangles
their relations to other societal groups with conflicts and violent
extremism, leading to their passiveness and poor participation in social
interventions.

First, getting physical access to herdsmen is limited because
transhumance and nomadic herders are located in remote places, several
kilometres away from villages, and their practice of moving from one
place to another to feed their cattle defeats easy identification of and
accessibility to their location. The lack of footpaths and road networks
to herders’ locations in forested areas also limits the possibilities of
accessing herdsmen’s locations in the field. Herdsmen do not disclose
their locations and movement routes for security reasons – that is, to
avoid being easily found and attacked by conflict actors. Access to
herders’ data is compromised by their non-participatory behaviour in
conversations and the habit of keeping information restricted to only a
few people, often their relations. Conflict victims poorly segregate
emotions from the actual conflict experiences they share, and the
attachment of emotions to information hampers access to objective data.

A wider range of social relationships, including social identity and
membership in groupings by ethnicity and religion, negotiation of social
relations to authority and relations of friendship and trust, and access
to geographic knowledge of pastoralists, enable access to pastoralists’
data. Researchers and practitioners invest in obtaining geographic
knowledge of pastoralists, and others cultivate social relations with
pastoralist groups via maintaining ties along religious and cultural
lines to gain access to them. There is a network of herders and cattle
owners in villages and towns. Pastoralists maintain close relations with
their family heads and local leaders, even with those who are physically
located in distant places. During family occasions and social and
religious gatherings, most herdsmen take advantage of meeting their
close relations. Researchers employ the contacts of family heads and
local leaders to reach out to cattle headers who are difficult to
locate.

Finally, the study has identified opportunities to aid access to
pastoralists’ data, and this includes the existence of strong customary
institutions and their traditional role in mediating land access, the
local government and police services, NGOs, and pastoralist
associations.
