**Data Intermediaries for Good**

> Can Data Intermediation Services Help Data Access in Research?

*Matteo Nebbiai*

Data is a crucial competitiveness factor for an increasing number of
organizations in the global economy. At the same time, asymmetries in
data availability are generating debates on the effect of digital
markets on the functioning of markets,^1^ competition policy,^2^ and
capitalism.^3^ This asymmetry is also reflected by the limited benefits
that the academic community obtained from the ‘big data flood’. Various
scholars have highlighted how online platforms such as Facebook and X
(formerly Twitter) act as gatekeepers of data that are crucial for the
advancement of various disciplines.^4^ Despite the emergence of research
strategies vis-à-vis big data holders, such as data scraping and the use
of legal tools,^5^ researchers’ access options seem still limited in
comparison with the possibilities available to the companies.

In the last decade, the European Union (EU) has adopted a variety of
measures to improve data sharing among businesses, consumers, and
researchers.^6^ The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), 2016,
introduced the right to data portability, which allows data subjects to
obtain their personal data from controllers and transmit them to a
different one.^7^ The Digital Markets Act, 2022, obliges large online
platforms to share with other businesses certain categories of data
generated by consumers,^8^ and the Digital Services Act, 2022, sets a
procedure for researchers to access the data of large online platforms
or search engines.^9^

In addition to this top-down approach, EU legislators increasingly see
‘data intermediaries’ as potential facilitators for consumer-to-business
and businessto-business data transactions.^10^ While a shared definition
remains debated, ‘data intermediaries’ can be described as actors
positioned between data holders and data users that facilitate data
sharing.^11^ It has been suggested that the focus on intermediaries is
attractive because it ‘lies between the two extremes of selfregulation
and detailed binding statutory obligations’.^12^

The Data Governance Act (DGA), adopted on 30 May 2022, introduces a
series of rules for intermediary actors, by creating the categories of
‘data intermediation services’ and ‘data altruism organisations’.^13^
Despite the ambitiousness of the DGA, many doubts and criticisms about
its clarity and impact have been raised.^14^ Particularly, it is not
clear whether the regulation will help to make intermediaries
competitive with well-entrenched ‘Big Tech’ firms^15^ and which actors
will ultimately benefit from their functions.

The DGA proposes a separation between data intermediation services
(DISs) as purely commercial activities and data altruism organizations
as non-profit projects supporting research purposes;^16^ however,
empirical observation of extant DISs show that the picture might be more
nuanced. As illustrated later, some commercial intermediaries offer data
access opportunities for researchers as well. For this reason, the
chapter focuses on the following question: do DISs make data more
accessible to researchers?

The first section analyses the text of the DGA to set the foundations
for the empirical investigation. The second section reveals the
methodology followed to build an original dataset including 54 DISs. The
third section investigates the data access options offered by DISs
through a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the dataset. The
fourth section discusses how the DGA provisions may impact researchers’
data access options. Finally, the conclusions sum up the findings and
propose policy interventions and further research paths.

# The Data Governance Act 

The DGA aims to promote data sharing among governments, businesses, and
individuals.^17^ In this chapter, I focus on the DGA provisions
regulating ‘data intermediation services’ and ‘data altruism
organisations’.

‘Data intermediation services’ are defined as services aiming to
‘establish commercial relationships for the purposes of data sharing
between an undetermined number of data subjects and data holders on the
one hand and data users on the other, through technical, legal or other
means’.^18^

Article 10 specifies that the following typologies of DISs are subject
to regulation: (*a*) services intermediating data exchange or joint use
between data holders and potential data users, also by offering
technical, infrastructural, or other means; (*b*) services enabling data
subjects to make their personal and non-personal data available to
potential data users, in particular enabling the exercise of the GDPR
rights (that is, PIMSs^19^); and (*c*) data cooperatives, which are
organizations composed of multiple data subjects having one of their
main objectives the support of their members in the exercise of their
data rights (that is, making informed choices on data processing consent
and negotiating terms and conditions for data processing on behalf of
their members).^20^

The DGA establishes mandatory rules for DISs, aiming for data
standardization^21^ for fair and transparent data access^22^ and the
neutral use of data^23^ (see the fourth section for more details).

‘Data altruism’ is defined as voluntary data sharing by data holders,
without monetary rewards, for purposes of general interest, such as
healthcare and scientific research.^24^ The DGA establishes an
*optional* registration procedure to become a ‘recognised data altruism
organisation’.^25^

The DGA considers data altruism organizations and DISs as distinct types
of initiatives, whose line of demarcation is the operation on a
for-profit or not-forprofit basis.^26^ Moreover, it recognizes in data
altruism organizations the purpose of supporting academic research,^27^
whereas the DISs are only defined by their commercial purposes.

However, the empirical observation reveals that some DISs also offer
data access opportunities for researchers. For instance, Quli is a Dutch
service to store health data and transmit them to healthcare providers,
and it allows the sharing of such data with researchers.^28^ CitizenMe
offers an app allowing citizens to share data for monetary rewards; such
data is then made available in a marketplace which is used for research
purposes.^29^ These observations back this chapter’s research question:
can DISs make data more accessible to researchers, thus redistributing
part of the data sharing benefits to the academic community?

# DISs Dataset 

To answer the research question, I have created a dataset that aims to
include the highest possible number of DISs available in the EU. To
build such a dataset, it is firstly necessary to understand what a DIS
is. This is no easy task, because the DGA provisions are far from
straightforward,^30^ and the definition of ‘data intermediation
services’ is open to various interpretations.

First, the service must ‘aim to establish commercial relationships’.^31^
It is unclear if mere providers of technical data sharing infrastructure
fall under this definition because it might be difficult to assess when
they are aware of the existence of commercial relationships occurring on
the infrastructure they built. In the dataset, I exclude the projects
which do not host data sharing procedures that involve the use of
monetary transactions by any of the parts (data holders, data users,
intermediary).

Second, data sharing must happen ‘between an undetermined number of data
subjects and data holders on the one hand and data users on the
other’.^32^ Read in conjunction with Article 2(11)(c) and Recital 28,
this specification seems to exclude services that are used (*a*) by a
closed group of entities and (*b*) by a single data holder to enable the
use of its data.^33^ However, we currently lack specifications on the
features that make a group of entities sharing data ‘closed’. In the
dataset, I exclude all projects whose business model is to require data
sharers to pay consultancy-like services to implement data sharing
infrastructure within their organization (thus creating a ‘closed
system’).

Third, data sharing intermediation can occur ‘through technical, legal,
or other means’.^34^ In the absence of a *de minimis* threshold, this
provision possibly enlarges the scope of the DGA to entities that
intermediate data sharing only sporadically and without any technical
sophistication. In the dataset, I take under consideration only entities
that have, among their declared goals, the systematic enabling and/or
facilitation of data sharing.

This chapter must be read taking into account the dynamic nature of DISs
regulation: First, the interpretation of the DGA will evolve following
the European Commission’s delegated acts,^35^ judiciary interpretations,
and further regulation or soft law. Second, the governance and business
models of DISs will evolve as well, also in the attempt of service
providers to comply with (or circumvent^36^) the DGA. For these reasons,
the chapter must be considered as an exploration of trends that shall be
verified by further empirical research, especially after the DGA enters
into force.

To create the dataset, I extracted the projects that can be considered
DISs according to the criteria mentioned here from five initiatives
aggregating data intermediaries. These are, to my knowledge, the
existent projects that systematically created datasets of data
intermediation initiatives: (*a*) the MyData organisation,^37^ (*b*)
Mozilla’s ‘Data Stewardship Landscape Scan’;^38^ (*c*) the ‘Data
Stewardship Explorer’ by Aapti Institute;^39^ (*d* ) the Ada Lovelace
Institute’s list of case studies;^40^ (*e*) the ‘Data Collaboratives
Explorer’ from New York University’s GovLab;^41^ and (*f* ) the Data
Institutions Register from the Open Data Institute.^42^ Finally, through
a snowballing technique, I have added to the dataset all the projects
that I found mentioned in the empirical analysis of DISs and the
academic literature consulted to write the paper.

The included projects must have been accessible by both data providers
and users in the territory of at least one of the EU members or the
United Kingdom (UK) between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2022.
Projects that never passed the stage of prototype (that could not be
used by a data holder or user simply by accessing its webpage) were not
included. Projects whose material was not available online^43^ on the
date of 31 May 2023 have been also excluded. The final dataset is
available in Table 10A.1 (Appendix 10A).

> The following features have been collected for each DIS:

-   *country of establishment* – that is, where the organization running
    the DIS is legally established;

-   *type of DIS* – that is, the category identified by the DGA^44^ into
    which the organization falls:

> a\. infrastructure: services offering infrastructure intermediating data
> exchange between data holders and users (that is, data marketplaces);
> *b*. subject-centred: services enabling data subjects to make their data
> available to data users and exercise their GDPR rights (that is,
>
> PIMSs); and
>
> *c*. cooperative: organizations supporting their members in the
> exercise of their data rights. For some DISs, more than one category
> could be applied; the ‘dominant’ one has been decided by analysing in
> which order the provider states its main goals; and

-   *data specialization* – that is, some DISs focus on data related to
    a specific disciplinary sector (health data, agricultural data, and
    so on), whereas others are non-specialized (that is, data
    marketplaces and PIMSs that collect data from other services or
    platforms).

# Empirical Analysis

The dataset contains 54 DISs. As shown in Figure 10.1, most of them are
based in the Netherlands, the United States (US), the UK, and France.
Particularly, the Netherlands has such a high number because of its
ecosystem of ‘personal health environments’ used by citizens to share
data with the healthcare system.^45^

Figure 10.2 shows the frequency of the features collected in the
dataset. The figure on the left shows the ‘types’ of DISs, according to
the taxonomy proposed by the DGA (see the previous section). The
majority of DISs in the dataset are subject-centred (that is, PIMSs and
services helping individuals to manage their data and exercise their
data rights), and there is a significant number of DISs enabling the
infrastructure for data exchanges. No operating data cooperatives have
been found in the data collection. The figure on the right shows how
many specialized (focusing on data related to a certain disciplinary
sector) and

unspecialized DISs are contained in the dataset. The majority of DISs
gather data from a specific sector – particularly, 2 collect
agricultural data and 34 collect health data.

To understand whether these intermediaries can improve data access for
researchers, I first need to conceptualize which features indicate how
‘open’ a DIS is to researchers’ data access. The concept of openness
includes whether academic researchers (affiliated with a university or a
research institution) can access data from a DIS, how easy is it for
them to access data, and whether some particular procedures are
dedicated to facilitating or improving their work.

To operationalize these concepts, I took inspiration from the literature
that measures the governments’ data openness. DISs, like governments,
are gatekeepers that regulate how large amounts of data are
distributed.^46^ Therefore, similar features can be taken into account
to measure how much these organizations are open to sharing data with
researchers. Particularly, I scrutinized the literature on the *indexes*
measuring how open government data are to third parties, allowing them
to create services, products, and research.^47^

Widely cited examples of these indexes are the Five-Star Model of data
availability,^48^ composed of five levels depending on whether data is
available

**Figure 10.2** Frequencies of types and data specialization of DIS

on the web with an open licence, machine-readable, using non-proprietary
file formats, using open standards, or linked to other people’s data for
context; the Four-Stage Model of data availability,^49^ composed of four
levels depending on whether a government offers a description of the
procedure to access information, data available in a non-reusable and
non-machine-readable format, data available in a reusable and
machine-readable format, or data visualizable with predefined tools; and
the Open Knowledge Foundation model, which scores data openness
according to whether data is produced in digital format, publicly
available, free of charge, available online, openly licensed,
machine-readable, available in bulk, or updated.^50^ Finally, in the
last years, the FAIR principles have diffused as guidance for scientific
data management and stewardship; they promote findable, accessible,
interoperable, and reusable data.^51^

Drawing inspiration from these models, I created a list of features that
could be observed in DISs to measure their ‘openness’ vis-à-vis academic
researchers (the draft list is available in Table 10A.2 \[Appendix
10A\]). Then I analysed the website and documentation (that is, white
papers, slideshows, explanatory material, and so on) of every DIS in the
dataset. To make the research more accurate, I used the Google search
engine to scrape the websites’ content by using the following keywords:
‘research’, ‘academic’, and ‘university’. Where no English version of
the material was available, I relied on online translation services.

Through an inductive process, I removed from the list the features that
did not appear in any DISs and added features that were not included in
the initial list. The final list includes three features that have been
observed in existing DISs and are outlined in Table 10.1.

  > Data access mention                               The possibility for researchers and academic institutions to access data from the project is explicitly mentioned.                  Mentioning the possibility of data access for research purposes suggests that academic needs have been considered during the design of the DIS and support for researchers is available.
  > Dedicated data access                             Research or academic institutions are provided with dedicated procedures to access data.                                            Dedicated procedures facilitate accessing and tailoring the data for research purposes.
  > Documented implementation in a research project   The data accumulated by the initiative has been employed in documented research activity by researchers or academic institutions.   The existence of projects using the DIS’s data demonstrates the accessibility of such data for research purposes and possibly suggests dedicated tracks to access data.

I report here some examples, drawn from the dataset to better explain
each feature, together with snippets taken from the DISs’ websites:

*Data access mention*: Patients Know Best and Gezondheidsmeter are
services through which patients can create a record of their health data
and share them with healthcare providers. The websites of these services
explicitly mention that patients can give consent to share their data
with medical research groups and institutions.

> With Patients Know Best patients can give direct consent to share
> their information for research purposes. Organisations can select the
> institutions to work with and help share this data seamlessly in
> real-time with those selected research groups and associations.^52^

*Dedicated data access*: Seedlinked is a platform that allows growers to
run seed variety trials. The platform offers a dedicated option to allow
university researchers to create and study the trials. The service
Selfcare allows users to integrate the measurement data from various
devices in a ‘personal health environment’. With the consent of the
users, researchers can obtain data on a targeted population across a
certain period.

> Research using wearables with which participants can carry out
> measurements themselves in their own (home) environment is becoming
> increasingly important. With the use of SelfcareResearch, this data
> comes to the researcher in an automated manner. As a researcher you
> have access to a dashboard where you can export the research data
> 24/7.^53^

*Documented access for research purposes*: BitsaboutMe and CitizenMe are
services that allow consumers to provide data about their purchasing
behaviour and lifestyle, and to share anonymized information to earn
money. These services have been used by the University of Zurich and
University of Leeds to conduct research on the changes in consumer
habits and preferences.

> To participate in the research project … you agree to share your
> purchase history of Coop and/or Migros (or REWE in Germany) with the
> research group. This will be done completely anonymously, so no
> personal data such as name, email, etc. will be transmitted.^54^

Figure 10.3 shows the number of DISs that possess research openness
features. One out of four DISs mentions that their data can be accessed
for academic purposes. One out of five DISs offer proof that research
projects have been pursued thanks to the access to their data. On the
other end, only a small minority of projects offer data access options
dedicated to researchers. Figure 10.4 shows

how many DISs possess one or more data openness features. Overall, about
30 per cent of DISs in the dataset possess at least one data openness
feature.

This data shows that the majority of DISs do not offer any data openness
features. Unsurprisingly, the majority of DISs are businesses that have
more interest in establishing commercial relationships than in pursuing
research partnerships. In the analysed cases, most of the partnerships
with researchers attempt to promote the quality of the service, rather
than suggesting that the interaction with the scholar community is a
core feature of their organization. Research-friendly features are
rarely at the forefront of the promoting material (that is, the
website’s homepage). Nevertheless, the share of DISs having at least one
data openness feature remains significant. This is surprising given the
forprofit nature of DISs and the fact that these services have no
official connection with academic institutions.

Figure 10.5 shows the frequency of DISs’ research openness features
disaggregated for DIS type and data specialization. When looking at the
difference between subject-centred and infrastructure DISs, we find that
both types offer data access options; however, subject-centred DISs
offer data access options more often. As regards the difference between
specialized and non-specialized DISs, the specialized ones seem more
likely to offer data openness features. Also, only ‘specialized’ DISs
offer data access options dedicated to researchers. Overall, the low
number of DISs does not allow for any causal inferences. However,
neither the DIS type nor the data specialization seems to completely
foreclose the possibility of offering data access options for
researchers.

This explorative data allows the elaboration of two hypotheses to be
tested with further research: (*a*) infrastructure DISs are less likely
to offer data openness features because they host ‘neutral’ and
‘technical’ infrastructures for the exchange of data and do not have any
interest in favouring the access to specific categories of data users;
(*b*) DISs specialized in a certain type of data are more likely to
offer data openness features because they have a particular interest in
gaining legitimacy from the scholars of the discipline and/or it is
easier or less costly for them to provide useful data to the academic
community.

# The DGA Impact on Research Openness

This research investigates the choices of DISs providers *before* the
implementation of the DGA, whose provisions on DISs will enter into
force in September 2025 (Article 37). In this section, I report which
provisions are more likely to interact with the research openness
features of the DISs and comment on what such impact might be.

**Figure 10.5** DISs’ research openness features disaggregated for DIS
type and data sector

*Source*: Prepared by the author.

*Note*: Each bar represents the share of DISs belonging to a certain
category that have a data openness feature.

Article 12(1)(a) introduces a ‘neutrality obligation’ by requiring every
DIS provider to ‘not use the data for which it provides data
intermediation services for purposes other than to put them at the
disposal of data users’.^55^ The impact of such a provision on data
access for research purposes is difficult to foresee. On one hand,
neutrality prevents DIS providers from developing vertically integrated
business models^56^ that could facilitate offering services useful for
researchers (that is, data analytics and manipulation services). On the
other hand, limiting the competition between DISs to the modalities they
put data at the disposal of data holders might push providers to improve
data access openness.

Article 12 (1)(d) requires every DIS to ‘facilitate the exchange of the
data in the format in which it receives it from a data subject or a data
holder’:^57^ through this measure, the European Commission aims to
prevent service providers from imposing their own data standards, thus
causing lock-in effects.^58^ Standardization measures can improve the
efficiency of data usage by researchers because they reduce barriers and
prevent the loss of valuable information when merging multiple
datasets.^59^

On the other hand, forced standardization might hinder the
diversification strategies of new companies, thus entrenching the
regulatory power of a few powerful actors.^60^ For instance, this could
happen if the standard chosen by a firm becomes dominant in a certain
sector and is mechanically replicated by the mediation of DISs. The DIS
providers ‘shall convert the data into specific formats only to enhance
interoperability … or if requested by the data user or where mandated by
Union law or to ensure harmonisation with international or European data
standards’.^61^ Therefore, the providers maintain various options to
convert data formats, but the ‘exceptional’ framing of such options
might have chilling effects.

Finally, Article 12 (1)(f) requires DIS providers to allow access in a
‘fair, transparent and non-discriminatory’ (FRAND) way for both data
subjects and data holders.^62^ This provision aims to limit the
discriminatory treatment of data holders and to support organizations in
weak bargaining positions.^63^ This could facilitate data access for
researchers, even though DIS providers could still use forms of ‘pure
secondary line differentiation’ (that is, a DIS may be willing to
transfer data only to research projects that it deems of sufficient
‘quality’).^64^ A possible solution is to specify a list of contractual
terms that are considered ‘unfair’ when imposed by data holders on
certain categories of data users (that is, researchers), like the
initial proposal of the Data Act, 2023, protected small and medium
enterprises from unilaterally imposed data sharing clauses.^65^ For this
purpose, a broader safe harbour for researchers could be created by
enshrining a ‘right to research’ in future legislation.^66^

# Conclusions

This chapter has explored the following question: do DISs make data more
accessible to researchers? To answer this question, I have identified a
set of

‘research openness features’ that facilitate data access for researchers
when they interact with a DIS. Then I built an original dataset of 54
DISs and investigated how many of them present such features. The
findings show that the majority of DISs do not offer any research
openness features; nevertheless, there is a significant share of
services (30 per cent) that at least mention data access for research as
one of their goals, offer dedicated data access option to researchers,
or have collaborated with academic projects. It is possible to draw
three reflections from this analysis.

First, these results show that, in a significant minority of cases, DISs
are a valuable tool to access data for academic researchers. However, in
the future, this situation might significantly change due to the DGA
implementation and the evolution of the market. Further research should
investigate the causes driving the supply of data access options to
researchers, by testing the hypotheses on DIS types and data
specialization, but also the role of the actors governing the
intermediaries^67^ and the corporate interests in data sharing.^68^

Second, the empirical analysis shows that to understand how the DGA will
impact the distribution of data among societal actors,^69^ it is
necessary to take into account how data intermediaries interpret,
exploit, or circumvent the new rules. A growing literature has
investigated how the preferences of targeted actors affect the outcome
of personal data regulation^70^ and data access regulation.^71^ The DGA
stresses this aspect even more because it explicitly assigns regulatory
functions to some types of intermediaries.^72^ For these reasons, the
DGA should be interpreted as a case of ‘decentred’ regulation, which is
defined by Julia Black as the recognition of ‘a shift … in the locus of
the activity of “regulating” from the state to other, multiple,
locations’.^73^

Third, the chapter shows that the approach of the DGA, which considers
‘data altruism’ operators as the only type of data intermediaries that
can favour academic research, is too simplistic. The DGA allows only
non-profit organizations to be identified as ‘recognised data altruism
organisations’. In the long term, this might discourage for-profit
initiatives from sharing data for research purposes, because they cannot
obtain such a certification^74^ and might have unintended consequences
in transnational data sharing partnerships.^75^ Also, it might
jeopardize their economic growth because some of their services cannot
flourish at their fullest potential.^76^ In such a scenario, the DGA
would ultimately foreclose – instead of empowering – the researchers’
access options to a greater amount of data.

Hence, this study shows how data access regulation requires a more
careful assessment of the political economy of targeted actors. To
tackle some of the identified issues, I advance three policy proposals
that could be introduced in the European Commission’s DGA rulebook:^77^
delegated acts, new regulations, or soft law.

First, the interpretation of DGA provisions illustrated in the fourth
section should favour academic research; for instance, the European
Commission should ensure that the FRAND requirements are applied
consistently in the case of academic research and could mandate
compliance to particular sectoral standards to facilitate a
standardization process that is not driven by private actors and where
scientists are heard.

Second, the European Commission could develop tools (that is, sandboxes,
research grants, and so on) to incentivize DISs to experiment with forms
of data sharing with researchers, with the aim of making these
relationships selfsustaining in the long term.

Finally, the European Commission should amend the DGA to make for-profit
projects recognizable as ‘data altruism organisations’ – this would
prevent chilling effects on data sharing with researchers and allow more
effective monitoring of (real) data altruism initiatives.

Mentioning the possibility of data access for research purposes suggests that academic needs have been considered during the design of the DIS and support for researchers is available.
  > Dedicated data access                             Research or academic institutions are provided with dedicated procedures to access data.                                            Dedicated procedures facilitate accessing and tailoring the data for research purposes.
  > Documented implementation in a research project   The data accumulated by the initiative has been employed in documented research activity by researchers or academic institutions.   The existence of projects using the DIS’s data demonstrates the accessibility of such data for research purposes and possibly suggests dedicated tracks to access data.
  > Free of access                                    Research or academic institutions can obtain data for free or with a monetary discount, contrarily to other actors.                 Economic incentives facilitate the use of DIS data for research purposes.
  > Governance representatives                        Research or academic institutions are formally allowed to influence the governance of the organization.                             Academic representatives can represent research interests within the DIS.
